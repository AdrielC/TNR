Here is a collection of all the questions and answers:

Question: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnkw)
>I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?

Answer:
>I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.

>What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?

Answer:
>Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.

>What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?

Answer:
>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.

>What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?

Answer:
>Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.

>How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?

Answer:
>We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.

>We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?

Answer:
>Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.

>Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?

Answer:
>Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.

>How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?

Answer:
>It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to Gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!

Let's skip the marijuana legalization question that'll show up at least 50 times on this page and get to a related issue: After promising that you wouldn't interfere with individual state decisions on medical use of cannabis, how can you justify utilizing federal funds and agencies to shut down dispensaries and arrest people who are legitimately sick?
I can confirm that this is indeed legit.
Marijuana prohibition has resulted in the arrest of over 20 million Americans since 1965, countless lives ruined and hundreds of billions of tax dollars squandered and yet this policy has still failed to achieve its stated goals of lowering use rates, limiting the drugs access, and creating safer communities.

Isnt it time to legalize and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol? If not, please explain why you feel that the continued criminalization of cannabis will achieve the results in the future that it has never achieved in the past?
What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?
It's been stated that your favorite television show is The Wire. How do you think the war on drugs has affected America, and would you work to end it?
Mr. President, do you feel that there is a problem with the "revolving door" of congressmen and prominent lobbyists? For an example, I'd point to former Senator Dodd, now the chief lobbyist for the MPAA. Is there anything to be done about it?

Abdulrahman Al-Awlaki, a 16-year-old American citizen, was killed in a US drone strike (presumably one you ordered) in Yemen last year. Sure, the teen's dad was an Al Qaeda propagandist (and in close communication with Osama bin Laden), and he was probably collateral damage, not a target himself. Still, how does it make you feel? Do you ever think about it? Knowing then what you know now, would you still have ordered the strike?
President Obama, why didn't you close Guantanamo Bay as you promised you would?
Mr. President--Thank you for doing this!

You're likely to get a lot of questions about policy, and those are important; but I'm interested in hearing a story. Can you tell us about visiting a favorite town or location, anywhere in the world, and why the experience stands out in your memory?
Your administration has been very quiet regarding Americans' issues with the TSA and their invasive security procedures. Your administration even [pulled](http://www.infowars.com/white-house-pulls-down-tsa-petition/) a petition regarding making them answer a court order regarding the naked scanners.

Do you have any plans to reel in the over-reaching, rights-infringing bureaucracy the TSA has become?

What are you going to do in your second term to address the failed war on drugs?
Mr. President,
What are you doing about returning soldiers with PTSD, particularly those that have acquired various drug addictions.  I know there are a lot of VA facilities available, but they still have long waiting lists for the best inpatient programs.  I ask because of my brother, who did three tours in Iraq, was prescribed oxycodone for a wartime injury, and came back with a bad heroin addiction.  Please do more for these troops!  Thank you.

My question is this: Why would you sign the NDAA when it included language that would allow the indefinite detention of Americans without due process. I understand that this was the de facto case for awhile. Now it's law. This passed by overwhelming bi-partisan support, despite being hated by most citizens. It feels like the government, including the Executive branch, no longer work for the citizens that elect them. (By the way, I fully supported your first campaign, but I'm now disillusioned and disappointed.)
How can you claim the power to [assassinate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhaDWmYNZ2E) and [indefinitely detain U.S. citizens without trial](http://www.salon.com/2012/05/16/federal_court_enjoins_ndaa/)?

Mr. President - What issues, if any, do you agree with Mitt Romney that are not commonly endorsed by the majority of the Democratic Party?
Since this is the house that kn0thing built, let me ask a tech entrepreneurial questions.

1. I just found out yesterday about the changes your administration has proposed for tax rates on C-Corps (dropping the rates to 28%).  Why isn't anybody talking about this?  I feel like this is something that you'd want to make sure to get across to folks in the entrepreneurial world!

2. Does the democratic party know how much distrust it's sown through the SOPA/PIPA efforts?  I'm a staunch liberal, and made sure to call my congress critters over this issue.  Despite the extents to which your administration has done on awesome tech issues, SOPA/PIPA hit a really sour note for folks like me.
With all the patent lawsuits taking place recently, it has become painfully obvious that the system needs revision. Action or inaction on this issue can affect innovation for years to come.

Barack, I know you've received a lot of criticism for "Obamacare", and it may not be a perfect solution, but I think it's a step in the right direction. It has personally been a big help within my family.

I lost my big sister to cancer exactly 3 months ago. If it weren't for some of the laws you helped create, she would have left her husband millions of dollars in debt. Because of those laws, she was able to fight it with every possible treatment we could find without worrying about where we would get the money.

Thank you. 

I only wish she could tell you that herself, she was very grateful for the chances she was given. My whole family is grateful.
Well. This is a surprise.

How could you see your second term differing from the first in the sense of overall effectiveness with Congress? It's seemed as if the Legislature has made several attempts of yours mind-numbingly difficult to pull off -- could you see yourself playing hardball a bit more with the Republicans in Congress if you win a second term?

And hey, thanks for doing an AMA. Good luck in November -- I'll be voting for you again in Tennessee, although the rest of the state will likely not... again...

Hello, Mr. President!  Big fan. :-)  I'd like to know what you feel about what I think is a very under-talked-about issue...assisted suicide.  I'm 35 now, but when I'm older I don't want to suffer with some slow-moving cancer or other terrible, uncurable disease. It's a big fear and it's sad so many people have to die with so little dignity.

What's your position?

As a college student who is interested in politics, what was it that first inspired you to go into politics? What's your first recollection of being interested politics?

Hi, big fan here.  I've got two quick questions:

Do you consider the War on Drugs to be a failure. Why or why not?

And second, what do you say to the families of the US Citizens you've ordered droned to death by executive fiat, and how does such an order comport with your understanding of constitutional law.

The NYTimes did a 7 page story on Obama's kill list, and "terror Tuesday" meetings in which he looks over his personal kill list with his advisers.

Mr. President, why do you let the Republicans talk trash to you or even interrupt you during your speeches? I wouldn't be upset if you ever tell them to sit down and shut up, you know... 

Edit: I really don't understand why I'm being downvoted. For the last 4 years, he has dealt with so much crap from the Republicans. I really want to know why he just doesn't stand up for himself. He's the President of the United States. If you don't agree with him, it's all good, but show some damn respect for the **PRESIDENT**.

Hi Mr. President! Welcome to Reddit and thanks for taking the time to talk to us!

So a lot of people on Reddit say that there is little difference between you and Gov. Romney - I think the reason that they say this is mostly because of the wars in Afghanistan and overall military policy, and that's the place where people want to see the most change. 

My question is this: what can we expect from you on this issue that we won't see from a Romney Administration, or what will be the key differences in your defense policy from Romney's?
Why do you think the majority of politicians are so slow on understanding and the proper use/etiquette of digital media? And do you feel you have a strong understanding of the medium, or do you rely heavily on experts around you?
President Obama: What is one belief or principle about government that you want to let the Reddit community know that separates you from your political candidate, Mitt Romney?

Mr. President, I was fortunate enough to see Al Gore speak at a private event earlier this month. During his presentation he repeatedly impressed  that climate change is the great challenge of this generation. He also spoke of the recent cap and trade programs that have begun in India and China. What is your impression of these programs, and do you see something similar being effective in the United States?
What are your thoughts regarding the media's reluctance to fact-check political statements for fear of accusations of bias?

You know? I never would of imagined that I'd ever have a chance to interact with the President of the United States. I am appalled by the actions of the government, those on the campaign trail, and the companies that make the rich and powerful take precedence over the poor and weak. I am ashamed of a government dominated by supposed "Christians" that's agenda has been sending off our friends, siblings, and other relatives off to fight for the interests of corporations. I am ashamed of the desperate need to expand the size of our miltary forces instead of working to diminish the size of the military. I am upset that being an economic hitman is supposedly what is good for me as a member of the LGBT community and yet homelessness, poverty, and injustice strikes many LGBT people and threatens to destroy them. I am saddened by the fact that many people do not have homes and instead we have private prisons that uses inmates for cheap labor.

You know Mr. President? I was wanting to post something incredibly angry, but all I really want to know is what are you going to do to fix it?
Dr. Obama, several months ago you rode your big 'ol bus through New Vienna, Iowa and waved at people on the street. I believe you waved directly at me as well, during this very presidential visit.

Do you remember me? I was the guy with the hat.

Mr. President: I'm a woman in my mid-twenties. It seems like every day a new legislator or public figure makes YET ANOTHER outrageous attack on my body and my identity as a woman. If you're elected in November, what steps will you take to ensure a firewall between this misogyny and women everywhere? What should we do to try to change these demeaning ideas- which, I think, are far less fringe than we'd like to believe? Thank you and good luck in November!
If reelected, what will you do to help further integrate alternative energy into the American infrastructure?
Isnt it time to legalize and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol? If not, please explain why you feel that the continued criminalization of cannabis will achieve the results in the future that it has never achieved in the past?"
Mr. President, why did you insist on the continued imprisonment of Yemeni journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye?  Is he being punished for revealing that it was a US Tomahawk missile that killed 14 women and 21 children in al Majala on Dec 17th 2009, not a Yemeni air strike as reported by the pentagon?

Why don't you tax the movie stars and celebrities and producers who make crap remakes and then earn millions a year for the rest of their lives? They are ones people should be angry at. The best they contribute to society is a short stress relief. Then they have the audacity to demand massive fines and law suits while they sit on millions because some one pirated one of their movies? That is a complete mutilation of intellectual property laws. Everyone knows that John Doe didn't create Avatar so why is he and other innocent bystanders getting hit so hard just because he watched it without paying $30 for it?
Dear Mr. President

You responded to my little sister's letter once, thank-you for being an actively involved leader. It meant a lot to her. I am a first year medical student. I am worried about the debt I am taking on. I have read a lot about the healthcare bill and the student loan bill. I have also been hearing a great deal (from my professors and peers) about how America has the most expenditure on healthcare while being ranked rather low on our healthcare system. Is your bill the first step in a larger plan to remedy our failures in the system? I did not choose to become a doctor for money, but should I be worried that I will not have the opportunities that my father had once I get my MD, especially while the debt I took on is greater? Thank-you again for your time.

Sincerely,
American Boy from NY
Stop asking questions.

This AMA ended.... A Month Ago.

Also, it even says 
>Ill be taking your questions for half an hour starting at about 4:30 ET.
Have you ever seen EpicMealTime on YouTube? If so, do you like it?
Wow! Regardless of what anyone thinks politically, you can't say that our leader is not in touch.  Very impressive, Mr. President!
1) Why are you taking money from Wall Street and then your Justice department pardons Goldman Sachs?

2) Why do you aid Israel (An apartheid country that lives on blood and money of Americans) ? Also explain how is Zionism not bigotry? (Actually any non-secular policy is bigotry)

3) Why are you having a kill list and killing innocent people to make more terrorists? 

4) Why are you expanding US military presence abroad where it is not our business? 

5) Why are you supporting NDAA and extending the patriot act?
Do you think it's justifiable to imprison or fine someone for a crime that doesn't involve violence against someone else? Has a family member or friend of yours ever been charged with a victim-less crime? Do you feel that was the most effective way to change their behavior?

Mr. President, I am a resident of the District of Columbia.  It seems like voting rights for DC has been a ridiculously politicized issue, with Democrats generally in favor and Republicans generally opposed.  If you are re-elected President, what do you plan/hope to do to break through this stalemate and provide some basic level of elected representation to the 600,000 tax-paying citizens of the District?
The republicans have included 'Audit the Fed' in their platform. Something that I agree with. Do you agree with this or plan to look into the Fed in your second term?
President Obama. With everything that is going on around the world and our debt approaching 16 trillion dollars, don't you think it is time we stop the wars and close down at least half of our bases?
Is anyone else reading this in his voice?
What, if anything, can you do to block the voter suppression measures in swing states like Pennsylvania?
I know he's no longer answering, but I feel this question should be higher up. Why are you allowing suppression of third parties? Obviously, a third party taking votes from you isn't your favourite idea, but shouldn't America have more than two choices?
President Obama, I have two questions for you. While each are equally important to me, feel free to answer either one. I am a sixteen year old female planning on joining the Navy's nuclear propulsion program. If elected for a second term, what would you do to ensure that alternative energy is moving forward? I am asking this because after serving in the Navy, I would like to see a substantial growth in support and funding into the search for a cleaner and more efficient  energy source. Thank you in advance for taking the time and consideration to respond. 

Now for my second question. If faced with a sudden outbreak leading to the dead rising and attacking the living, what would you do? What is your zombie apocalypse plan? Once again thank you and I really hope that you get a chance to respond. Have a good day. :)
Even though I know this post is late, and will most likely get buried and might never read it, I want to simply thank you for the Deferred Action Process. You have brought hope to me and my family. I promise to do something good for our country as well as to give back to those who need it.
President Obama, if another country was treating a captured U.S. soldier the way that PFC Bradley Manning was treated in the brig at Quantico, VA (conditions deemed "cruel, inhuman and degrading" by UN Chief Rapporteur on Torture Juan Mendez), would you deem that acceptable and [appropriate](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/11/obama-bradley-manning-tre_n_834669.html)?

Mr. President, first off thank you SO much from the bottom of my heart for your time for this!  This is so incredible!  You have already earned my vote!!!

I have 2 simple questions for you!

1. What is your plan to cut government spending?

2. Since yesterday was the 40th anniversary of the War On Drugs, what is your stance on legalizing Marijuana?

If you respond to this, I will be so happy.
Hello Mr. President,
With the increasing amount of attention being placed on the healthcare industry, do you have any plans to encourage tort reform? This seems to be the most overlooked solution to the problem of rising healthcare costs. 

Secondly, 
You recently announced that you were a supporter of gay rights, but that it was a state issue. Gary Johnson gave you some flack for the remark, stating that human rights were a federal issue, and that no state should be able to keep rights away from its citizens. Have you put any thought into perhaps taking your support of the gay community a step further?

Thank you for your time; I can't say how exciting it is to see a high powered politician here taking questions from the people. 

-iron_cynic.
Salutations commander in chief!

Mailman here. What are your solutions to the current financial problems facing the USPS, and what do you think it's role will be in the future?
Why do you see the issue of marijuana legalization as a joke?
Hi Obama, I'll be honest. I don't like ALL of your economic policies but hey, I sure as hell don't want some douche who can't make up his mind most of the time running our country.
Why did you approve more draconian [Patriot Act](www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/27/patriot-act-extension-signed-obama-autopen_n_867851.html)
Why are people still asking questions? Its over guys!
Well the leader of the free world has discovered reddit... Nothing productive will ever happen again
lol The AMA has been done for over 17 hours yet people are still leaving questions on here hahahah!!!!
Obama could say "I had chicken for dinner last night" and would get 2000 upvotes.
When's Half Life Three coming out?
how can people downvote this?!?!
good time . i am from iran. why the us army does not attak to suriya like libiya?
President Obama, I have a request for you. May you please win the elections?
Are you a brony?
I suggest to you, that you tell us something secret. Doesn't have to be a big one, just let us in to a presidential secret. I know that at first thought this may seem unnecessary and risky. However. Yolo, sir. Yolo.
Holy shit, people are still posting on this and asking him questions? It's been six days guys. o_o
Why are people still asking questions here? Didn't he only answer the first 10, and that was 4 months ago.

Dear Mr. President, 
I am a college student. I am a supporter of your domestic policies. I believe that your economic and social policies are the right thing for our country.
Why is it that any male of possible military age is labeled as an enemy combatant when killed by a drone strike in Afghanistan? 
When I hear news of enemy combatants killed in the war, I feel that I am being lied to. I don't believe in the killing of innocent civilians as collateral damage, and I don't like being lied to about it. Why is this policy in place? How do you justify this as a human being?

Mr President, I am not asking this question because I want to tear you down. I am asking this question because I really would like to know your answer. It is not a question that has been answered by your administration. 

Thanks, 
Brian
Hello Mr president,
as a resident of the UK i am just wondering what is your honest opinion on the Eurozone Crisis. How would you handle it?
[deleted]
Dear Mr. Obama:

Please, do some actual _change_. The U.S. are falling behind. Health care is expensive, education is expensive, many cities are insecure. The country is now built around part of religion and part of enforced control over its citizens (said to be protection).

The U.S. needs a mentality change if it wants to go back being one of the greatest countries in the world. Right now, it is just a plain scary place to live for anyone having lived in developed countries somewhere else.
I'm willing to bet that this account, comments to its posts, and the emails it receives are being monitored fairly regularly. If not by you, then by a member of your staff. It would be irresponsible not to. So how about mothballing the NSA's new data center in Utah? You know, the one that is said to be able to intercept and store all of the world's digital communications. Including domestic communications. Why is this necessary? Why should my emails and social networking comments be stored forever on government servers? Even if it's just being stored, and not accessed, it is unacceptable. You must put a stop to this.

Another thing is bio-fuels. If the bio-fuel industry is to grow, it cannot be using crops that would otherwise go towards food. Just because it can be used, doesn't mean it should. Especially if it will just drive up food prices. It is a known fact that fewer people rely on algae for food than corn. It is also known that algae can be turned into bio-fuel. So.... The choice is obvious. Use algae.

Now to save some money.. I propose an across the board 25% pay cut for all members of Congress, the Senate, and for your and Joe Biden's positions. Additionally, your health plans should be converted to high deductible plans. By increasing the amount that has to be paid out of pocket, you are decreasing the burden on tax payers.

GMO labeling.. If Monsanto can pick and choose what type of food to serve in their own cafeteria, which is rumored to be mostly organic, then we the people should be able to as well. Access to safe food is a fundamental human right.

Alternative energy tax credits. Republican want to put an end to this. They feel that these industries should be required to survive on their own merits, without the aid of the US Government. If these credits are to be done away with, then to be fair, this must also be applied to any and all tax benefits enjoyed by the oil, gas, and coal industries. Fair is fair, is it not?

Microchips, semiconductors, and electronics manufacturing in general needs to be taken away from China and performed here. The Chinese government cannot be trusted. You know this. So why trust their country with the manufacture of our electronics? Yes, they manufacture them to do what we want them to do, but how do we know that they're not adding in additional features that we cannot detect. To make a chip do what was asked by the customer is easy, just as easy as making it also open doors into the system fro remote access. Access that could go unnoticed until it's too late.

The Senate candy desk. Get rid of it.

Decrease paid time off for elected officials. If the US workforce doesn't have mandated minimum vacation days, as many other countries do, perhaps neither should US government elected officials.

That is all for now.

For now...
Why do you feel like Americans don't deserve a right to a fair trial? Do you think NDAA and the Patriot act are constitutional?
Many of our younger users here believe they can change the election process by voting for a third party candidate, when (if given only two options) would have voted for you.

What advice would you give these voters?
Assuming you are re-elected, will you increase your rate of judicial nominations in your second term, and ask Harry Reid to push for more confirmations? This is one area that I think Republicans have been incredibly successful - packing the courts with hardcore conservatives - and obviously we've already seen some of the negative results. I'd love to see more liberals in the court system, and the pace of nominations in your first term was fairly slow.

Also, best of luck! I'll be making calls - I think it's incredibly important that you get re-elected given the Republican vision for our country.
Over the last decade, we've seen international stalemate at both the UNFCCC and Rio+20. In your next term, how will your administration foster an atmosphere of transnational collaboration on global environmental problems?
How often do you find yourself having to refrain from saying something because of how media might misconstrue a saying, or take it out of context (no examples necessary)
What I would like to know is what you consider to be the fair share the wealthy should pay?

I mean, you and so many others claim that they fall short. But assuming we're talking about those in the top bracket, and they pay at the maximum present rate, how much more should they be paying?
What can your administration do in a second term to more actively protect women's health and reproductive rights in the US?
Do you think the two party system in the US is a detriment to our democracy? If so, how would you propose to fix it?
How is it possible for you to have the reddit name PresidentObama? How long have you been lurking?
Can we trust you to speak out against the discriminatory ballot fights attempting to rollback/halt/limit marriage equality in MN, ME, WA, and MD?
Why is so much effort put on discrediting the other parties candidate? Why do you feel negative advertisements sway voters more easily than, say, positive ones about specific policy decisions you would make when in office?
Top questions I'd jump through hoops to ask Obama (3, 4, and 6 are top priorities!!!):

1.  You promised to close Guantanamo and other secret prisons, but failed. All you have to do is sign your name on an executive order. What's stopping you?

2. Why did you use federal troops to arrest people using drugs legal in their state? Why do you continue to support the drug war when it has incarcerated millions of non-violent, sick people, disproportionally effects African-Americans, and leads to violent gang wars?

3. Why is Iran a threat? Even though there is no evidence they are seeking a nuclear weapon, why would we care if they were? They are surrounded on all sides by countries with tens and hundreds of nukes. Are you (and all those favoring sanctions on Iran) suggesting that they are suicidal or irrational? If anything, wouldnt Iran aquiring a nuke ceate more stability in the area? Predicting his response: Regarding the wipe Israel off the face of the earth quotation: I am sure you are aware that Sean Hannity made that up, and Ahmadinejad said no such thing. Regarding terrorist organizations, I am sure you are aware that their numbers are in the hundreds, and that there are just as many terrorists organizations in the US, and no one is worried about them stealing our nukes.

4. Your election team keeps harping about how Mitt Romney will decrease taxes for the rich whereas you will increase their taxes, while maintaining tax cuts for the middle class. You said the same exact thing in 2008 and then turned out to be no different than George Bush or John McCain when it came to tax policy. You even supported corporate bailouts of the banking and auto industries while the middle class received a much smaller stimulus. Why should we trust your campaign team this time around?

5. Please tell us exactly why Bradley Manning is in jail. We've seen the information he leaked to Julian Assange. How does the information leaked in anyway harm US military strategy, aside from descreasing public support of war? Doesn't the American public have a right to know how our taxes are spent? Doesnt the US government have a policy of rewarding those who expose corruption?

6. Your administration is under enormous pressure to cut. Have you seriously considered our foreign empire? Our presence is unwanted in most countries and used as a recruiting tool by terrorists. The terrorists who attack us have been extraordinarily clear that their cause is to end our foreign empire by bankrupting our country. We are killing millions of civilians in what we call "collateral damage," perpetuating this 11 year war. The middle east will take years to rebuild, and we consistently hold back their progress. Wouldn't we be safer, more prosperous, and better liked if we were not involved in countries that have not wronged us and do not want our "help?" While politicians argue about blisters and bruises, we are ignoring an enormous cancer.
The one time I get to directly ask the President of the United States a question, my mind goes blank.
This is incredible. Welcome to Reddit Mister President!
What do you think of Ron Paul right now, refusing to endorse Mitt Romney despite what must be great pressure from the GOP?  I'd characterize him as brave.
I know you won't reply to this but I'll ask anyway, even if it sounds silly. Mr. President, why is that you have become so against marijuana? Don't you think such a large number of people want to know before they can trust a person running their country?
Am I the only one that thought

barack ob**AMA!**
You have my vote in November, Mr. President. 

Obama, Biden 2012!
I missed this because I was working at the RNC all day today (funny because myself and most of my co-workers are already planning on voting for Obama).  I am very sad :(

Mr. President, Thank you taking part in reddit. I wish you good luck in your upcoming election.
Mr. President, What are your plans for the education system in America?
This is going to get buried with the other ~20,000 comments. I live in Canada and I have only been to the United States once. I had a great time but I spent a lot of time just trying to cross the border. Shouldn't improvements be made so that border wait times are decreased?
I'm most impressed by his ability to only remain on reddit for 30 minutes.
Hello, Mr. Obama, sir. 

When you were five, what did you dream of being? Was president on your mind at that point?

Thanks for stooping to Reddit's lowly atmosphere and taking our questions. Have a phenomenal evening!
Well. Huge props to Mr. President for knowing his meme, right?
I'm not even American and I want to vote for obama.
Obama on Reddit?

Fuck it, I'm going to register to vote just to vote for you.
President Obama, hi I'm from hawaii and I've been watching the republican convention and they have been talking crap about you. I know you don't care and you just laugh about it but I was wondering are you going to say anything back to republicans? We are on your side, I know you will win.
Hey Barack how do I shot web?
Does this mean it's ok for me to be on Reddit at my Federal job since my boss was on it?
I think this might be the thread with most comments ever!
Almost 50/50 redditors for and against Obama. Good indication for a close election.

I'm not an Obama fan (or Romney) but I'm impressed that he took the time to pay reddit a visit.
Came here to see a picture of our president holding a "Hi reddit" piece of paper.


I was disappointed.
http://i.qkme.me/3qoykl.jpg
I'd never vote for you based on your politics, but you've gained an enormous amount of respect from me for this.

Thank you Mr. President.
As a conservative leaning redditor here is my take:

1. Space now please
2. Hooray Beer
3. Internet Freedom FTW
4. Family Values!
5. Troop Surge NOOOO (my brother was there)
6. Small Business...
7. Econom....

All in all the President didn't use this opportunity to start a smack talk fest against the GOP. Although it's likely the timing was purely for press reasons to keep him being mentioned during the RNC and to possibly get the attention of Dr. Paul supporters, he should still be applauded for avoiding the brutally partisan responses that would have fed trolls on Reddit for months.

Would I vote for Obama? Probably not, while he seems like an alright guy and has always been at the forefront of internet and social media, that to me doesn't replace the dismal state of our economy, the continuing dependence on China or on imported foreign workers and welfare. To me it also doesn't displace the distaste of the healthcare system he proposed and passed or for the dilapidated state of the student loan industry, a bubble nearing it's breaking point.
 
I would rather have an ahole president that got the economy back on track than an alright guy to hang out and golf with. Mr. President, you deserve my respect as commander and chief, you have earned it with your willingness to expand your scope of reach, however you have not swayed me or my ilk. 

If you would mend your tongue against harsh outlashes against conservatives, improve your economic policy, fix the growing student loan crisis before it bursts, reduce dependence on china, take a serious commitment to border security and job regrowth for teens and college students then you just might get my vote.
This whole thing looks like one big karma buffet. I came to upvote the scraps.
Mr Obama is there anyway that we can have the people the congress serve up to two terms and have to be voted? I think having a president only serve a current amount of years is unfair if the rest of government can stay in office for many many years. I think our government can or is corrupted in that way. There should anyways be fresh new faces in our congress.

Have you ever smoked canabis? And would you ever consider legalising it?

Okay, why are people downvoting this thread? At this point there are 123914 upvotes and 114869 downvotes. Who cares if he did not answer many questions legitimately, or if he broke the servers? We should still upvote the POTUS if he makes a showing on our website!
I am sorry to hear about what happened to you at the end of Season 4, Breaking Bad. I wish the best for the future of Los Pollos Hermanos.
I feel like there are way too many politicians that put more value in keeping their jobs over legitimately wanting to help the country.  I feel like term limits for Senate/House reps could help reduce this kind of issue.  Would you be willing to support term limits for congress members?

Just gonna shoot this one out: Does your administration plan to do anything about the copyright industry's relentless attacks on the Internet? We already defeated SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, and others, but there's still the TPP which still has very big problems with it's IP chapter. Why are we exporting bad laws we won't pass overseas?

Additionally, there is the bigger fundamental problems with US copyright and patent law: Why must copyright last as long as it does? Why is it so fundamentally overbroad compared to the protections that production companies actually need? When is MegaUpload gonna see their data back? You spoke with Lessig at least once during your 2008 campaign, but it doesn't seem to have rubbed off on you. :/
When are you going to close Guantanamo?
Why are you against the legalization of marijuana and discontinuing the failing War on Drugs?

Good afternoon Mr. President, and thank you for taking the time to participate in this venue.  I think I speak for everyone (Americans and everyone else alike) when I say that it means a lot to us.

As for my question; I would like to hear your account as to how the election cycle takes a personal toll on you, and how you stay motivated and generally upbeat in the midst of being constantly scrutinized.  I understand it is a tough (and sometimes thankless) job, to be sure, but when you find yourself in an example such as being taken so severely out of context (**you didn't build that!**), how do you turn that frustration into a positive motivation?
Mr President. I'm an 18 year old startup founder from the UK, I've started projects in the past with a hundred thousands users and revenue and have built a level of credibility in the tech/startup industry. Why is it so hard for me to get a visa because I've decided to opt against going to university? I'm going to have to try for an O1 when there should be a startup visa. 

The UK government wants us to stay in the UK but Silicon Valley is still the centre of technology, at this rate it may not be for long.

I know many founders that have raised money from US investors, have employees and have become very successful but can't stay in the US and have had to chose another country to base their company in.

Just want to say how happy I am the the Patient Protection and Affordable care act was passed and given a stamp of approval by SCOTUS. With that said, do you think we need to do more in this country to make higher education affordable to everyone? For example, in the Scandinavian countries higher education is essentially free because it is seen as an investment in the future of the country. Should America move toward this system? Why or why not?
Thanks so much for doing this!!! Here's my question:

Mr. President, if you could have done anything differently throughout your term, what would it have been?
Hello Mr. President! What is your favourite way to relax?
What was the best date you ever had with Michelle?
If you could have one super power, what would it be?
President Obama, can you PLEASE ask Mitt Romney to point out specifics for his budget during the debates. And if he does not provide anything specific can you PLEASE exemplify this monstrous flaw in his campaign. IMO he's running a campaign on ever changing promises and lies. I have literally been waiting since last November for these upcoming debates, largely due to Romney's foreign policies. CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE HIM LOOK AS RIDICULOUS AS HIS POLICIES ARE IN THESE DEBATES!!!!

(Side note: if possible please remind the nation that when Romney promises to take out Iran with an Iron Fist, that means he will be initiating another war like Afghanistan/Iraq)
During your presidency it seems to be you've tried many times to "reach across the aisle" and find some compromise, only to have your hand smacked back. For example, the Affordable Care act has many elements originally proposed by Republicans, like the individual mandate.  Once these were included, though, they became "obamacare" and were anathema to them.

Assuming you win a second term, do you plan to take a more oppositional approach in the future?  

I'm really not sure the other side is more interested in governing than they are in "winning," and they've been very successful following their strategy.
Why aren't the propagators of the greatest financial crisis since the great depression being accountable?  Does your administration plan to, during your second term, pursue criminal prosecution against those who defrauded the American public?
How can we use the internet to make a difference in the election?
Commander-in-Chief,

I am a veteran of the United States military, and I am currently using the Montgomery GI Bill, which is amazing by the way. However, I have a couple of concerns about VA disability and GI Benefits.

1.  When filing for a VA disability claim the approval process takes over a year, which is too late for veterans that are in dire need of help. I have friends that have either committed suicide or become addicts. Is there any way that we can increase the VA staff that takes care of these claims? 

2. The chapter-33 education benefits does not pay full tuition for a large number of private institutions, and so is there any way of maybe paying for some of these more tuition heavy schools?

Thank you Mr. President and I look forward to voting for you in the upcoming election.

Mr Obama. I live in California and work as a clerk in a grocery store. I see time and tina again many ebt card users buying non essential food group items... Hot food...deli items... candy...energy drinks. I've also learned that if you do not use your monthly allotment it carries over to the next month. I once saw a man with over $6,000 on his card. My question is what will you do to crack down on this kind of spending and if someone doesn't use their monthly allowance why do they need this card?

Thank you mr president.
Mr. President -

Facing the potential of an even larger Republican majority in Congress come 2013, what will you do to ensure progressive legislation gets passed and, more importantly, what will you do to turn the tide back towards the Democrats (or at least sensible conversation) in 2016 and beyond?
Hi Mr. President! I still can't believe you're doing an AMA - thank you!!  
  
A few questions...  
* How are you planning to address the growing problem of debt caused by massive student loans? Are you considering some sort of dept forgiveness/amnesty program?
* Do you have any plans to expand funding for technological research, particularly that of stem cells and the biotechnology field?
* On a lighter note, how are your girls? Excited to start a new school year? Have they joined you on the campaign trail? Will you let them stay up past their bedtime on election night?  
  
Thanks again for doing this! We know your time is extremely valuable so this means a lot.
Do you believe a two party dominated system can be sustained in America? Of course, you are entitled to your views as a Democrat, but our system has devolved into one side versus the other, which really doesn't bring any progress or aid the public. Do you think there's hope for a more unified country?
If re-elected what will be the DEA's role in marijuana prevention? Will it be decreased or increased?
Mr. Obama, what are you going to do to combat Mr. Romney's recent surge in the polls, fundraising, and relentless republican attacks and focus on the current state of the economy.  I have seen so many ads and speeches blaming your supposed poor economic oversight, but little in the way of assigning the blame where it truly belongs: the obstructionist republican house and the failed economic policies of the early 2000s.
Would you please consider expansion to funding for secondary education in the science and engineering sector?

Additional investment in infrastructure is important, especially considering the ASCE's recent assessment of the state of our infrastructure. Decreasing the cost of engineering and science education could help this considerably. 

I personally have a high interest in the state of federal funding for engineering professions as a Mechanical Engineering student unsure if I will be able to pay for college this semester.
Mr. President,

If you ordered the shutdown of Guantanamo, and congress failed to fund it, wouldn't the military still have to obey the directive by whatever means necessary, or am I misunderstanding the distribution of power?

Sorry if this is a tough one. It goes without saying that your job is difficult, and I have nothing but respect, but I didn't want to waste the opportunity on something less important to me.
Dear President Obama,

Why is your administration actively fighting in court for the authority to detain American citizens indefinitely without charge under the NDAA?
Welcome to Reddit, Mr. President!  I'm a federal employee, and I'd like to ask one thing-  

Would it be possible to put Senators and Representatives on Social Security?  The people on the Hill now seem to want to "save money" by tightening MY belt, rather than perhaps saving tax payer money that's being spent on themselves (and their ridiculous retirement plan).  

I also think that, as a side bonus, perhaps Social Security could be improved, if the people who have the power to change it, are now a part of that system.  

Thanks so much for the AMA!
Favorite white house bathroom?
Mr. President -  I would hope you would want a fair race. What are your thoughts on the exclusion of Gary Johnson, Libertarian Presidential Candidate, from almost every national poll and therefore the Presidential Debates? Gov. Johnson is constitutionally eligible and will be on the ballot in all 50 states and raises important issues.

These are troubling times in our nation and having free and fair elections is a cornerstone of democracy. Exclusion of a qualified eligible candidate seems absurd to the average American. If you truly believe in "bi-partisan" collaboration, why not multi-partisan collaboration?
Mr. President, why aren't you bringing more attention to the blatant lies and distribution of misinformation that characterize the Republican party? They are extremely aggressive. I understand taking the 'high road,' but at a certain point you need to gather support from people who are, frankly, too ignorant to sift through the facts. 

Why don't you call them out more publicly or use the same tactics? You can't possibly trust Americans to do research... Can you?
I met you at a function in Springfield, IL and then again at a campaign function in Dayton, OH. Both times you were extremely nice and genuine. I just need to know.. Both times you smelled quite good. 

**What cologne do you wear?** 

I might be creeping on the president...
Be honest, are you here because you read my article?

"So I guess that leads into one AMA Request:

Mr. Obama, Reddit awaits."

Mr. President, I think it is great that you're on reddit, welcome! 
I wanted to ask you about your potential second term. What sort of things, if any, do you think you will be able to do knowing that you will not be running for president again?  

In other words, it seemed to me that almost right from the beginning of your first term, certain decisions were made knowing that you would be running for a second term. It seemed like this had a moderating influence on some of your positions.

If you do win (and I hope you do), what sort of political freedoms will you have, that you didn't have in your first term? Are there any ideas that you have that you felt may have been too politically risky to try in your first term, but would try in a second term?

As a staunch liberal, I was disappointed in your first term in the sense that many of your programs, which I do support, seemingly could have done more. For example, I wanted an individual mandate from your health care plan. With that being said, I think your doing a commendable job, and I am proud to have you as a president. 

thx
I'm a former undocumented immigrant and first off, I want to thank you for repealing the widow law in 2009 that helped me get my green card.  However, I still see so many cracks in the immigration system and people fall through them and in some cases, never get out.  I know the GOP makes immigration laws such as the DREAM Act hard to pass, but if you are reelected, do you plan to make a bigger effort for immigration reform, like you promised to do during your campaign in 2008?
Have you thought about drawing outside of the political pool of candidates for future cabinet appointments? I think finding candidates with amazing credentials but no political experience would be refreshing.  I'd like to see your entire cabinet made up of the best brains in the country, none of which have been tainted by politics.
Does your administration have any plans to assist in improving funding to medical research over the next 4 years, through departments like the NIH?
I don't have a deep philosophical political question or anything. 

I view you as one of the more "human" politicians right now.  "Human" in the sense that I could see you as a neighbor or the guy down the street, and I appreciate that a great deal. 

Anyway, What's your favorite beer, and what's your favorite restaurant?

Is it hard to get out and enjoy the things you used to before being elected President?
Mr. President,

Before I ask my question, I'd like to say thank you for all you've done, I was given grants that helped fully pay for my last semester of college thanks to you (and our government of course), so thank you very much!

Now that you've been president, was it what you imagined it be?  If not, how did you imagine it?
Hello Mr. President.
Are there any plans to try and help ease the burden on school loans for college?
In this day and age, it seems you have to incur a huge debt in order to advance your education.


BTW, that verification picture is meme worthy.
Mr. President,
    Does the amound of cash pouring into SuperPACs concern you? Would you back a push to bring an amendment reversing Citizens United to the table?
#
Why did you sign the NDAA?  Why have you sold out the American people for the sake of corporate interests?  Why did you deceive all of us who voted for you in 2008; promising change, removal of troops from the middle east, only to increase troops and increase war?  Why have you not re-evaluated our federal government's failed policy of drugs that has lead to the criminalization of non-violent offenders?

You won't answer any of this but I still needed to get these questions off my chest since I'll never, ever have an opportunity to sit down and talk with you.
What's your favourite TF2 class?
A few questions:

How are you planning on bringing two divided parties closer together to bring together compromise? It seems the only bi-partisan efforts are done to limit our freedoms (SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, NDAA).

Why did the FBI attack Kim Dot com and  MegaUpload if the  administration is for the internet as an open forum?

Why is it that campaign ads use outdated or misleading data for its statements, which is then regurgitated by news networks as truth, misleading the American voters?  A 20 year old voter who is trying to use his vote right is having to rely on fact check.org or politifact.com to just get the right information.

How do you feel about news networks blatantly partisan with their messages, information, and stories (I.e. MSNBC, FOX to name one for both parties.

Thank you for doing this.
Hello President Obama,

Maybe this is just has something to do with a celebrity/President complex, but I find it very funny to imagine you doing anything other than signing papers and making speeches. 
In other words, it's awesome to imagine you doing normal-person things (even though I am aware that you are a normal person).

Would you be able to post a picture of yourself doing something along the lines of:

* Eating a bowl of cereal.
* Changing the batteries in a TV remote.
* Discovering that the milk in your fridge has expired.
* Playing Monopoly (and winning of course).
* Looking for a missing sock in the dryer.

Thanks for taking the time to read my ridiculous fantasy. I'm sorry that my question to the President of the United States of America wasn't more political.
Describe your Average day as president
Mr. President,

Why are you still spending millions on TV spots when you could reach your audience more frequently, more quickly and for free? Why not simply record a quick iPhone video every few days, personally saying all you need to say? Throw each one on YouTube and the news will likely show each one.

Then, in November, use your savings to buy Cincinnati that new bridge we need.

Just a thought.

Edit:politeness
This. Democracy is this thread.
Mr. Obama, would you like to come to England for a spot of tea and wife-swapping? We are excellent lovers, my man and I. PM if interested.
Cool. While I walked outside to bbq, my president did an AMA. 

*kicks rocks*
"PresidentObama added as friend."
Is it really already over? This was very poorly coordinated. If it was going to be this short we should have been given a 24hr notice so that the best questions could be upvoted and chosen.
For the first and only time ever /r/IAmA will have more visitors per day than /r/gonewild.
Don't be weirded out by all of the offers of fellatio, it's just their way of being nice.
So, let me get this straight. Barack Obama does an IAMA, gets over 14,000 comments.... And answers 9 questions?
Did anyone manage to avoid reading this in his voice?
Anyone else's duty today is to upvote all of the president's posts?
smart move coming over to reddit for an AMA. you seem like a pretty smart guy and it'd be fun to have a beer with you sometime. keep doing your thing, you do it well.

I just realized that Obama has AMA in it...
Dear Mr. President, the direction this country has taken is worrying me. 22 years ago, my husband and I came to Houston from Germany. We came for two years but my husband loved his work and we had the opportunity to stay. The US offered all we had in Germany as well a little more in opportunities. It was a good place to start a family. Today, I am deeply concerned about the country we are calling home. The main reason is the political divide that seems to be deepening. The Republican party is moving more and more to the right. Coming from Germany, the surfacing hate, the uninhibited power play of those who feel they are entitled are of great concern. Citizen United was a great set back, fortunately, the health care law was able to prevail. - We observe disrespect for democratic rules in some political circles as well intolerance and a lack of compassion for minorities and those in need. All of this is troubling. Despite this reality, you have, for the last four years, been a president that has lifted up those who have listened to you. You have lead the country with dignity, compassion and foresight despite all obstacles and obstructions thrown in your way. Mr. President, my children, our youth, the whole country needs the leadership that you have to offer, today more than ever. Republicans are aware that another term will consolidate the policies you have implied and which have begun to show success and improvement for millions of Americans. They are fiercely fighting for a chance to undo the progress that has been made. So, I am worried about the upcoming election. I am worried about the attempts to suppress voting opportunities for those who traditionally vote democratic. I am worried about the extremism that is clouding the horizon. - I hope, I pray, you will win this election. What I believe is needed is clear language. Communicating to the voters with examples and details, as well as exposing the repeated lies will, hopefully, bring your message across effectively. To go on Reddit was brilliant. Even though I am not able to vote, I will be walking the streets and working the phones. May this country come to peace before it can get more serious. Your second term and a Congress that can work, that is what is this country urgently needs.
When you're feeling stressed what kind of music do you listen to, and are there any artists in particular you prefer?

Edit: If you listen to any music when you're stressed that is.
He totally dodged questions about civil liberties, drone strikes and drug prohibition. *What a surprise*. Still though, neat.
Looks like the Republicans are starting to downvote.
Mr. President,  
Although I am not a supporter of all your policies or administration, I have to say that I do have tremendous respect for you.  I think you, more so than any president before (maybe other than the man himself Teddy R.!) have really actually embraced the people of the US on a personal level.  It's small things, such as your "birth video", your jokes and coming on this website are just what a president SHOULD be doing.  Connecting with the US as a person...not just a leader.  I hope more presidents take this approach, as I feel that most separate themselves from the American people too much - I believe that you at least retained a bit of being a 'real guy'.  
As an American, I look up to you.  As a Soldier, I salute you.  As a man, I respect you.  
Very respectfully,  
E.B.
This is history in the making. Thank you for doing so Mr. President.
Why did the Department of Justice recently decide not to press charges against anyone involved with the MF Global scandal?
Mr. President, I'm a member of the U.S. Army Reserves and have been for nearly 6 years now.  I love being in the military and I love the many challenges it has given me and am grateful for the number of doors that have been opened for me as a result.  However, there are some things that I'd like to tell you and get your take on them.  Firstly, my unit hasn't had anything in the way of up to date gear since I joined the army.  Most of our vehicles are leaking one fluid or another, we have no mounts for any of our crew served weapons and, the few occasions I have had load bearing gear, it looked like it had just got off a flight from Quang Tri province.  On top of this, my unit has been laden with what I would characterize as "toxic leadership."  NCOs who made their E-5 and saw to it that none of the junior enlisted did the same.  They fudged PT tests and terrorized their junior enlisted, simply because they could.  I believe in our military and in our fighting men but conditions in the rear are drastically, and negatively, impacting mission readiness.  How can we be expected to go on active duty and run with the big dogs of regular army when everything we have done as reservists borders on a joke?  It would be my great hope that in your second term (and I never thought I'd say this, especially as a republican, but I'm hoping there is a second term for you) that you would take steps to modernize our reserve and national guard.  That you would free up funds to get us the equipment that we desperately need to "train as we fight."  That you would implement regulations that thoroughly evaluate soldiers, not just when they became NCOs, but as they remain NCOs to ensure that good leaders are rewarded for their service, and toxic ones are punished, just the same as junior enlisted are.  I really see the reserves as a modern and powerful fighting force, but we could be so much more if we could do more practical and flexible training, AT's to do more than just train but actually do our jobs, etc.  Thanks for your time sir.
What are your thoughts on drug control for the next presidential term, if you get re-elected?

It can bring a lot of money into economy from taxes, and the quality can be controlled more easily. Also the availability of some of the drugs to teens would decrease.
Do you believe that the FED is the working in the best interest of the middle class?
Well done Mr President.

God bless his heart, but DO NOT let Biden do an AMA.
President Obama, I have a question for you that I'm sure may interest the reddit population...

What measures does the government have in place in the event of a zombie apocalypse?
Has the USA had contact with aliens?
Mr. President,

 What an Honor it is to even have the ability to speak to you, personally. Although I know there are thousands upon thousands of questions and comments, and I know there is likely zero chance of getting a response, I just want to humbly say Hello. Thank you for the work you do for our great nation, and thank you for the support you showed us, here in Joplin, MO, during the cleanup/recovery last year.
I wonder how many edits there would be if Bush did an AMA...
BRAVO MR PRESIDENT, BRAVO!

Thanks for making my cake day special.
I just wanted to say thank you for everything you're doing sir. From a soldier to his Cmdr in Chief. I have your Inauguration Speech and your speech from when you came to Fort Campbell after the death of Osama Bin Laden. Listening to them gives me a boost when I need it. 4 more years sir...
As a 17 year old that will turn 18 ten days after the election, its disappointing. I'd vote for you Mr. President if I could, but I can't.
Mr. President, I just wanted to thank you for you recent immigration act.  You have no idea what this means to me and I am very grateful.
oh jesus the downvotes
Take a look at the up/down votes people cause there's the election, B-Rock wins in a squeaker 51%, to Satan's (or whatever his name is) 49% 

 And I'm assuming the rebubs aren't controlling the voting system here so you better show up in November.
how are people downvoting the actual president of the US taking the time to do an AMA?

wow america
Please come back for a longer AMA sometime before the election.

And Reddit please upgrade your servers.

This is by far the coolest thing a president has ever done, in my opinion. You have my vote, sir.
Now within this next week when Romney will most likely try to do an AMA, he will most likely be bombarded with questions about his religious views, and we will tear him to pieces.
I know the President is gone now, and that this question won't get answered, but it's one that's been bugging me.  

Mr. President, you recently had a rally at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio.  There, you told the students that you would make it easier to get Pell Grants, and that more federal aid would be available should you get reelected.  You also stated how Mr. Romney was trying to cut aid to students.  My question is this: Why would I want more federal money?  I don't want the federal loans I have now, but the system as it stands nearly forces me to have them if I want to be able to attend college.

I don't want grants and scholarships to be more easily available, I want regulation on the schools.  It's a terrible, vicious cycle that is, to be blunt, screwing the students.  The schools get together and ask themselves "How much can we squeeze out of the students this year?"  They come up with a number, and the banks and private institutions go "Well crap, now the students will need more money.  I guess we'll just have to make bigger loans".  Then the Federal Government comes in and adds MORE money to the mix, allowing the schools to charge even more.  It's a cycle with no end in sight without somebody stepping in and doing something about it.

There has been plenty of talk on Capital Hill about "for profit" schools; The University of Pheonix, DeVry University, to name a few.  You want to know who the real "for profit" schools are?  Harvard, Yale, MIT, Ohio State.  The schools who charge upwards of $20,000 per quarter for no other reason than that they can.  They know that the students and their parents can't afford it, but they don't care because they know that between private loans and the Federal Aid program, they'll get the money they want.  I just got out of Wright State University, and with only the help of a private loan and Federal Loans to get me through due to my family having little to no money, after two years, I'm already sitting at over $35,000 in debt, and that's just to private loans.  $35,000 in two years.  I'm not even 21 yet for God's sake!  I can't even drink the pain away of knowing that at 20, I already have a MOUNTAIN of debt, and more to come if I want a degree that can help me land a job.  

So my question to you is this: if you really want my vote, if you really care as much about the students as you say you do, why do you keep letting the schools run rampant and why do you feel the need to leave us in the dust with a mountain of debt so early in our lives?
I read this in Obama's voice

Love how he completely ignores the marijuana questions.
Mr. O,

I am a school counselor for Chicago Public Schools.  I want to actually be allowed to work with students!  My proposal is one of the major sticking points (to allow counselors to work with kids instead of being made to be directors of special education and sit in legal meetings all day) that will force a teacher's strike in Chicago starting in 2 weeks.  What do you think needs to happen in our city and in the nation to help put our country on the right track to respecting education instead of corporations?
Why do you and other political aspirants try to break down your opponents instead of only building up your own campaign.
I'm very pleased that the president posted the link on registering to vote.  I'm living overseas and did not know how to do this.  Thanks!
I wonder what the response would be if Romney made an AMA. :O
Most likely flaming, and more flaming.

I wish I could've asked a question in time D:

You claim it is your responsibility to enforce the law (such as marijuana). This I understand. Why will you not enforce Humphrey-Hawkins full employment Act or Fraud by Banksters with the same vigor? This I do not understand.

Do you have any plans for intervention in Syria? What are your thoughts on the crimes and atrocities being committed by the FSA against Shia Muslims and Christians?

In regards to America's part in the 2011 Libyan intervention; How do you feel about the fact that more atrocities have occurred under NTC leadership than the crimes allegedly perpetrated by Gaddafi and Libya's previous government? How do you feel about the fact that the US/NATO bombing campaign left more Libyan civilians dead than terrorist acts carried out by Libya against foreign countries? In addition how do you feel about the governing system in Libya known as 'Jamahiriya'?
Dear Reddit,

Why the fuck did 163k of you downvote this?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Are you that childish and emotionally immature that a sitting president sitting down with your community is enough for your eyes to well up and try to prove how badass you are?  Grow the hell up, for everyone's sakes.
Made history.
Mr. President, I'm really sitting on the fence as to whether I should vote for you or Romney. What, in ALL honesty, do you think would make you a better President then Romney?
I heard on CNN at the GOP convention that 5 trillion dollars was added to the budget deficit during your administration's last term, is this true and if so why? And who do you think is responsible for the increase of the deficit?
"super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens."

Great sentence.
I am grateful that you are supportive on gay marriage, i wish you luck on the next election.
Mr. President, what do you feel about emigrants living in US? They live there, work hard, boosting up economy but they are there illegally. Would it be worth to take out visas for Polish emigrants? I have lots of friend live happily in US but only problem is that there are not able to visit theirs families back in origin Country. Is there any recent scheme planned to take out visas for Poland?

Mr President, I cannot wait to vote for you in Nov. Long time Republican that has finally seen the light! Thanks for the AMA, it's great to see you talking with the people.
For the first time in my life I am actually quite upset that I missed an AMA..
Mr. President: There are lots of questions about money. So I will ask a question about war. America is a young country compared to the rest of the world. Do you think it is time to wake up and realize America doesn't have to inflict war on every conflict that arises?
Does anyone else read his answers in his soothing voice?

Guys please read the last update from this AMA. Its officially over. So stop asking questions and wish/bash him well.
Why are you running so hard for re-election? You could be the President right now if you wanted to.
Is it just me or the other camp spend last 12h downvoting the OP to oblivion.
Why didn't you arrest any of the bankers or split up the "too big to fail" banks instead of paying them more and letting them consolidate even further.
Did you prefer the original Star Wars or the prequels??
Do you like cats?
I'm glad Obama's not a 9gager :D
Is there an Xbox in the White House ?
You talk about "strengthen our democracy", and I support this. 

There are several countries around the world where you don't have to register for an election at all, because you are automatically registered by the local authorities, for example in Finland, Italy, Norway, Isreal and Germany.

In my opinion, these countries understand that a democracy needs a strong and wide voting basis. The more people can go to an election, the higher is the approval for the democracy. So it is important, that the electoral law contains less obstacles for citizens to make their vote. 
A good start would be that every state has to allow election day registration. Can you change this at least for federal elections?

And by the way, thanks for giving us the opportunity to communicate with you in such a direct way!
Be nice to Canada, we are the Loki to the Thor
Mr President; I would like to take the time to ask you to consider plans for molten salt nuclear reactors. They are the safest form of reactor, with zero chance of melt down. They also use Thorium as an energy source, we have enough thorium on earth to power these reactors for 1,000 years.

I'd also like to know how you feel about put options being placed on United Airlines, and American Airlines days before 9/11, and then the SEC deputizing key members of government & business who where involved with this.

I would like to know why 2.5 million dollars of these put options from 9/11 where never claimed, and how Gary Webb managed to shoot himself twice in the head?

Also, testimony that the voting machines are rigged lead to two men from diebold dying.
Have you been banned from /r/Pyongyang yet?

Not a real Redditor until you do that.
I wish I'd been here for the upvote party.
Can you please make being a idiot against the law?
How do you feel about your runner up Mitt Romney?
Woody or Buzz Lightyear?
Hi Mr. President, Why is it legal for the Republicans to actively suppress voting rights? Is there nothing the DoJ can do to halt efforts to stop votes? Here's to four more years! Cheers!
Mr. President, I know this question isn't politically related but, do you enjoy playing golf?
Maybe we could turn this into a once-a-month sort of thing?
Hello Mr. Obama, I have a few questions:

First, are you planning to help Syria's rebels through the military, help them by training and supplying them leaders and supplies, or not take any action?

Second, What do you think of nuclear power? I believe the US should make it safer and better but what do you believe?

Also, I am wondering if you think a campaign focused on turning people who would vote for you into a people who do vote for you would be any better that winning swing states

Finally, I wanted to know if you look at Romney like a legitimate candidate you disagree with, or an ignorant and inferior polititian.
Mr. President, could you please give a one time offer of 5% tax to bring the trillions of money held in overseas accounts back to the USA?
Are you addicted to reddit yet ?
Mr. President, your passing of the National Defense Authorization Act was very controversial among us redditors, do you stand by your decision? Can you explain your thinking behind it?
congress should do what steve jobs did .work for a dollar a day until things get fixed. what do you think
I had a question... What makes it okay to launch airstrikes on Libya without Congressional approval? Especially after the deadline passed for needing to receive it. Too late now I think...
Mr. President, I'm sure you won't see this. BUT I wanted to let you know, I can't read the title of this without saying "I AM Barack Obama" in my head like you say it on the commercials. Job well done, sir.
Are Aliens real?
Mr. President, I bet my friend $50 that I could get you to say Hi to me, he of course, said no way I could achieve that. But now with this AMA, I finally have my chance to prove him wrong. So even though this is not a question, could you help me out Mr. President?
So Mr. President, what will you do if you get elected next election?
"Proof it's me: I tweeted about it."
I'm not a democrat,but I do respect the president for doing this.
Obama, if you don't win, And Romney wins, I will move far, far away from here. You're an amazing President.
Do you visit the WTF page of Reddit?
If I was old enough to vote, I am still unsure if I would vote to give you another term. Now that you have discovered reddit, nothing will ever get done over there.
Dear President Obama: At the Convention next week, tell everyone, no matter how ugly the truth is on how the Republicans opposed almost every bill you sent to Congress. They conspired together to stop and block your "JOBS BILL" and then tried blaming you. .Please, tell this and other things that your voters need to know to combat all their lies.
 
And by the way, I think you are doing a great job...a job that no other man wants. Keep up the good work...I, and others, have your back.

Mr. President,i am an Iranian girl who lives in Shiraz - Iran!
Glad i've got a chance to talk you personally...
I want you to know that what our government reacts to your suggestions is not what our people react...
we want a peaceful world,just like Americans...
We have a thousand years of civilization,we are not Arab...
Help us,you know that its just a kingship here and honestly we can not do any thing...
I beggin that war is not the solution... Its not fair both wet and dry burned.
 We would like to be in touch with all around the worlds...
we are under pressure...
Im just 23! I have a lot of dreams which none of them doesn't occur yet...
Please
I just wanted to be in this AMA as a part of history.  Hi President Obama!
So I'm guessing Mitt Romney is on 4 chan?
Why are people still posting questions?
Will you help with the way justice has been "served" for the West Memphis Three?  There is evidence against the stepfather, and yet he is still free.  Three children were brutally murdered, and three more spent 18 years in prison for a crime they did not commit.  How is it possible that the rules can be bent to accommodate political gains over what is ethical in 2012 America?

What do you think about Ron Paul? Have you ever worked with him?

Mr. President, the everyday person needs to possess a firm grasp on digital literacies to interact with our ever-changing connected world, and librarians are on the forefront of leading the teaching of these skills but many times lack the funding to properly do so. How would you do more to support libraries and librarians in your second term to ensure that all Americans bridge the digital divide?
Both parties have run decidedly mean-spirited and honestly truth-challenged campaigns. How do you plan to make your ads, speeches and surrogates more honest?
Do you feel that a "two-pronged" approach towards tackling our national debt by means of reducing government waste and raising taxes on high income earners is a *prudent* and *feasible* course of action?  Do you have any *tangible* solutions to streamline the government and minimize waste(however you choose to define waste)?

I only come on Reddit when I'm procrastinating, what are you procrastinating today Mr. President?
What did you have to  postpone in order to do this AMA?
Barack Obama, President of the United States, Master of Karma...
Hmm - really not impressed.  He just just cherry picked a few questions and added almost nothing to the national dialog. 

Here's all of his comments - exactly 10 at the time of this post... http://www.reddit.com/user/PresidentObama/comments/
Redittor for **TWO (2) DAYS**

**OVER 11,000 KARMA**

*This guy is going places~!*
It's amazing that the President did an AMA, but he only responded to 10 questions that he ignored all of the drug reform and Guantanamo bay questions. I know he's busy and all, being the fucking president, but if you do an AMA you should be prepared respond to the top questions regardless of content.
Why the hell did so many people downvote this? Even if you are a Republican, the fact that the *President* took time out of his schedule to talk with his fellow countrymen about the issues they care about is amazing. This kind of open forum and discussion is brilliant and to downvote it is just petty, not to mention against reddiquette.
As a Canadian might I say, politics aside, this is the coolest thing any world leader has done :D (in my humble opinion)
Mr. President, were you aware that the bird is the word?
First comment ever, lurked for years. Here's to you, Mr. President.
This is currently at the bottom of 22540 comments, so I doubt anyone will ever see it, but I just wanted to go on record and say that regardless of who you support in the upcoming election, it is cool as shit to have Obama posting on reddit.
Is there anyone else periodically checking this page with the comment sorted in order of 'New' just to check out the loonies?
Do you spread [this](https://www.worldsfoods.com/shop/pc/catalog/l/president%20butter%20french.jpg) on your toast?
Is there any part of you that thinks about the pros if you lost the election (less stress, spend time with family, ect.) or is that nowhere in the back of your mind?
How do you think we can improve voter turn out?
Good day mr. President,

Two questions:
1) Have you ever considered legalizing marijuana? 
     Being from the Netherlands, I find the way it is done around here a          good way. There's no need to have illegal drug deals, and I feel the use of hard drugs will decline.

2) Dog or cat person?

Greetings from the Netherlands! Rooting for a second term for you btw
I'm republican. I'll just see myself out.
I'm an unconvinced voter. Why should I vote for you?

Why do you want to be president again? Isn't the job much worse than you had imagined in 2007?
As a medical school student, Obamacare has been of particular interest to me and I congratulate you on at least addressing the most obscene flaws in our system. However, this is obviously a step in the right direction but more action is required.  What should the next step be for liberals in regard to healthcare after the ACA is fully implemented?
Why did you say you had "serious reservations" about signing NDAA due to the indefinite detention clause...but now your administration is appealing the supreme court injunction specifically on that clause?
Hi Mr. President, guess I'll just jump right into my question. What are your plans for the space program? It has been a postive symbol of unity in the country since the 60s and I think it would go a long way to both promoting STEM and attempting to heal the rift that this country has been experiencing over the last decade or so. 

Also, could I have your beer recipe?
One question: Is there going to be a time in *your* term of office that you finally stop Israel from keeping the largest open-air prison in the world and put an end to Palestinian suffering once and for all?

I'm not American, and the reason I ask this is to people like me, America is very much a hypocrite in this situation given the idea of "freeing people" that you folks have exported to other sovereign nations since the early 2000's.
Mr. President,

What are your plans to ensure that returning veterans are able to find jobs? As an EOD tech who is out in 2013, I hope it's a good one.

What is your stance on the recent plague of 'green on blue' killings in Afghanistan?  Do you think we will be able to make our time table?

I think it's safe to say that this is an absolutely unprecedented act and we redditors thank you for it.  Hopefully there are many more to come.
Well, Mr. President, this is now, officially, the top post in reddit history.
This isn't an AMA, this is a circle jerk.
Did he just end his post with a meme?
Pretty cool president.
You may not see this in the sea of comments, but Mr. Obama, I want to thank you for Obamacare. Please wear that title proudly! Without this there would be no way I could marry my fiance and switch health insurance. I'm 20  (on my Dad's plan) and was recently diagnosed with serious heart issues that would defiantly disqualify me from any health insurance that I desperately need. I would have also been without at age 18 without you. I can't just "eat right and exercise" this away like some of you opponents want me to and not need numerous heart scans, medications, tests, ect every year to keep this in check. Without this vital insurance, I would never be able to afford these necessities as I would not qualify for public assistance on my fiance's salary. My care easily adds up to tens of thousands of dollars a year without insurance. Don't even get me started on my easier access to birth control. Us (soon to be) married ladies need it too! Mr. Obama, I would like to say your health care plan has saved my life. **I no longer have to choose between marrying the love of my life or receiving necessary long term medical care for a serious condition. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
18080 comments and not a single word about Israel....we live in a dystopian reality.
I'm just posting here because our fucking president did!
What are your thoughts on the legalization of recreational marijuana on a federal level?
I find it funny that the down votes are blue.
Mr. President,

I sincerely hope that you succeed in this election. 

Greetings from the neighbours in the North.
Why isn't marijuana legal yet?
Please release all info about UFO's/Extraterrestrials
On the off chance that you have some underling scroll through the reddit comments, I would like to say that I am so tired of you compromising with the republican party under the guise of bipartisan politics. The fact is, and I think you're too smart not to know it, that the republicans more or less despise you, and often for purely racist reasons. How can you even tolerate such extremists, let alone give them half of what they want? 

Also, why the fuck has NOBODY been prosecuted for the mortgage crisis that sent the global economy into what some call a depression? Are they really paying you that much? What do you even do with all that lobbyist money? How can your and your colleagues' greed be so insatiable? It's certainly not what Jesus would do, though if I were a politician I know I would pretend to be a Christian too, so maybe you don't give a damn about that. 

How are we still fighting these endless, pointless wars abroad? Terrorism is the new McCarthyism, don't you see? It's so vague you can justify fighting these phantom menaces anywhere for just about any half-ass reason. If anything I would think our drone strikes and other death tolls on foreign people would INCREASE the likelihood of a terrorist threat! I've even heard military leaders assert this perspective. It's a massive waste of our federal budget! 

Also, I know that the government considers protesters as low-level terrorists, which is a bunch of bullshit. A smarter democratic politician would have used that movement to boost their own popularity and appealed to the populist sentiment. It's not like you've never said one thing and done another before. You could just lie like you almost always do. You could ride on another vague slogan like Hope or Change, and do nothing! I don't even mean to be offensive, it's just...come on...you know you lie all the time. 

You know, if you had more faith in your base you would probably still win. The majority of the republican party are total morons! You're charismatic and intelligent- you'd wipe the floor with them! I mean, what more can they do to smear you? They already imply you're a secret foreign terrorist Nazi, lol. They couldn't possible make a more offensive claim! What do you have to lose? 

Whatever. I know I'm just a serf and you're savvy, selfish politician without a functioning amygdala. I don't expect empathy or compassion from people like you. It must be hard not being able to trust anyone if you are the two-faced psychopath I perceive you to be. Keep in mind I AM voting for you. You're just the better of two evils, and I'm sure you like it that way. 

Also, on a less serious note: You should grow you hair out like in your younger days. It would just be cool.
Posting in a historic thread.  
     
     
Dear people of the future,
    
Giving hope to those who don't have any is equivalent to saving their life.  Smile as often as you can, work hard, and enjoy the occasional beer.  The meaning of life is the search for happiness. 
     
     
Sincerely,

P.S.  Boobs
Congratulations, terrible Republicans. You managed to down vote the piss out of something that is a very awesome gesture by ANY president in our history. No president has forwarded communication and reached out to us more than Barack. Even Mitt fails to attempt gestures of good faith and contact that Barack has. 

Shame on you.
> By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!

touche Mr. President, touche.
Stop the war, stop the wars man. People are dying dude.

Why did you sign the NDAA when you said you weren't going to sign it in. You then proceeded to pass it on NYE while no one was looking. Then said you would repeal it, but ended upfighting for it in court, and are now saying you won't use it.
he missed all the important questions  =(    but thanks for telling us which baseket ball player you like?  =/   someone kick the kids ass who asked that question..
Thanks you, a million times thank you for everything you've done for LGBT rights advances so far. I never thought I'd see the end of DADT, backing off on DOMA, and a president coming out in favor of marriage equality this soon. Keep doing what you do.
Thank you for your time, Mr. President. Can you please outline your plans to protect the open Internet and personal privacy on the Web?
If you could change the way elections were held, what would you do?

I've heard many suggestions, like alter the electoral college to be more democratic, do away with party affiliation for voters, or create rules for consistent primaries. Do you think we can make the system better?
Obama you have my vote and a few bucks towards your campaign.  Wish you were my brother :)
It seems that the debate on student loans boils down to "let them go broke" vs. "complete forgiveness for all!"  I think both of those are ridiculous options that hurt the country.  Has there ever been a discussion of a program that would help borrowers, without hurting the country?  For example, I would propose a three or four year moratorium on all federal loan payments, with no interest accruing.  Everyone is still completely responsible for paying their loans as they agreed to do, because every penny owed would still be owed, but borrowers would get a little time to get on their feet, put a little money into savings, inject some spending into the economy when it's badly needed, and not have to worry about loan payments, interest, or default.
What did you think of the 2011 film RAMPART?  
  
Also, did discontinuing federal support for manned spaceflight positively affect the future of the human race? How?
Why do you feel social issues have become one of the primary talking points of this election, as opposed to past elections where the focus was more on the economy or foreign policy?
How have you yourself changed after these last years? Like your outlook on life, values, etc.
What are the biggest obstacles for finally reshaping campaign finance reform and undoing Citizens United? Will you, Mr. President, in a second term, unburdened by reelection, be able to overcome those issues?
What is the administration doing to overturn #JimCrow voter ID laws that have gone in effect over the last three years.
Given the chance in a prospective second term, will you fight for a more liberal Supreme Court nominee than Sotomayor/Kagan (a la Diane Wood), or continue the trend of moderate appointments (with respect to your own views, of course)?
1) How can we shift the jobs debate to more of a careers debate?

2) Should the electoral college be modified to either be a factor if no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote or be modified to be a proportional electoral college? (I will note that I have nothing against the fine citizens of Iowa and lots of other smaller EC states when I ask this)

Where do you feel the direction of science and technology is going in the United States?
Welcome to Reddit Mr President - I'm from the U.K. and my question is: Considering the outdated, chauvinistic attitude expressed by the Republican party, how would you help change gender inequality in the U.S.A?
A professor of mine from law school (University of Chicago) is widely regarded among the students as having hired you.  So, is the genesis story true?  Did Douglas Baird actually hire you?  If so, any remarks on the process?
Mr. President, what is your opinion on the Republican Party's abortion plank in its platform? Do you believe it will impact the way women vote in this election? 

And of course, good luck in November!
Thank you Mr. President , one question.  How do you plan to counter the mis-information and flat out falsehoods the mitt Romney campaign are putting out with their commercials? also, I can't wait to see the debates between you and him...
What do you think about the rising gas prices?  Any chance it goes over $5 in the coming months?
Put simply, the government spends more than it takes in; how are we going to fix this before the floor is pulled out?
You're going to approve the Keystone XL pipeline after the election right? You agree that wind, solar, and alternative energy must be part of a larger and diverse energy mix, yes? What do you think of attaining North American energy independence by embracing a diverse number of sources (including real, proven and easily exploitable reserves) while allowing the private sector to innovate on the next generation of energy technologies?
Mr. President -- with all of the voter ID laws being passed around the country, why is the federal government not stepping in to stop these states from suppressing voter rights as a way to ensure certain groups of people do not vote?
What are your plans to promote small-mid size business growth, and why do you feel it is superior to your opposition?
Mr. President,

As a Democrat who voted for you in 2008 I will also be voting for you again in 2012, but my question is, this time around, can you please reach across the aisle *less* and simply create/support legislation that you believe in regardless of how Republicans in Congress may react? As evidenced from their behavior the last 4 years, regardless of how far right-of-center you lean, they will only want you to lean further to the right, so it seems that it's a fruitless act.

Other Democrats and myself simply want you to lead the way your ideals tell you to, that is why we are voting for you.

Thank you,
Mike (North Carolina)
I'm sorry Mr. President, but we need PROOF that you are indeed the real Barack Obama. Sign pic?
The National Debt is a huge hotbutton issue, and it seems the RNC made it a big part of their platform at the convention. What will you do to get the deficit back to 0 in your second term?

Will you introduce, support, and /or sign into law the repeal of DOMA and a law that give equal marriage rights for all including Bi-National Couples with equal immigration rights?
You're rhetoric against Millionaires and Billionaires is striking, but your plan for corporate taxes remains high.  Why not raise taxes of upper level income related through business profits, but keep taxes lower for corporations themselves.

Do you plan to address the problems with the War on Drugs in your 2nd term?
Do you think an Israeli preemptive strike on Iran is likely or more just media speculation?  How will the US respond if they do choose to attack Iran?
Mr President, states are starting to realize how much of a failure the war on drugs has been -- particularly the war on marijuana.  Many states have passed laws making possession of small amounts a civil offense.

As an admitted former toker yourself, what is your stance on marijuana legalization at the federal level?
Dear Mr President, in light of Robert Draper's book, "Do Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives" Draper wrote that during a four hour, invitation only meeting January 2009, with Frank Luntz, Senior GOP Law Writers, including Paul Ryan, literally plotted to sabotage, undermine and destroy America's Economy.  

What are your thoughts on this and I am wondering if your team plans to mention this travesty at any time during the next 70 days before election to bring this to the attention of the People?  I hope you do.
Mr. President, if you win the upcoming election, how do you plan on handling the issues of medicinal marijuana (such as the well publicized recent crackdowns) and the growing full legalization movement? 
Thank you for your time
What are you reading right now, book-wise?
If reelected, what would you do differently in your second term?
Mr. President: It is well established that you used cannabis as a young black man. Where would you be today had you been arrested for possession then? Would you consider that justice? Is it justice for those who have been sent to prison?
Mr. President, you seem like someone who could sit and enjoy a conversation and a cold beer with just about anyone.

That being said, any favorite brews?
What is your opinion on the many small business owners that say that they are afraid to expand because of your policies on businesses.
How do you justify the continued imprisonment of unconvicted (and in some cases uncharged) detainees in Guantanamo Bay, and how do you explain your lack of follow-through on your 2008 promise to shut down the program?  I voted for you in 2008 and have found it harder and harder to defend your administration in light of this reversal.
Hello Mr. Obama, 

I've been concerned about the lack of political action taken to address climate change. Why has Washington been so silent on the issue, and what would you do to address the climate crisis if you won a second term?
What did you want to be when you grew up and is being President better?
While you are fielding all these questions about policy, here's an easy one: how do I lead a happy and successful life?
Holy hell, sir! Thank you so much for this AMA!

So, er, are you feeling nervous for the upcoming election?
How was that username not taken?
What is your plan to reduce the national debt now that the economy is stabilizing?
One of the promises you've made before you were elected into office was to close Guantanamo Bay.  Indeed, you've signed an executive order to have it closed.  Yet it remains open today.  Can you provide a detailed explanation as to why that's the case, and what would be required (necessary conditions, etc.) to have it closed?

Thank you Mr. President, and I'm so thrilled about what you've done for LGBT rights in America.  Just a little bit closer to the Land of the Free!
What did you have for breakfast?
Hi, I'm a British person wondering what you were doing about these issues.

1) Are you trying to get Marijuana legal for everyone or just for Medical patients? 

2) How are you going to get LGBT rights?

3) Have you previously used Reddit and will you be using it again?

4) Who asked you to do this AMA?

5) What are your religious views?

Thanks, if I was American I would vote for you.
Many analysts consider your Health Care Reform bill to be your signature achievement of your presidency.  If re-elected, what would you hope to be the defining act of your final four years in office?
Why is Guantanamo Bay still open?
Do you believe the Earth has been/or is being visited by extraterrestrials (other than Mitt Romney)
What is your stance on the current islamization going on in the countries affected by the Arab Spring? For example Egypt with the muslim brotherhood becoming the ruling party.
Mr. President,

I have one major question. I am a firm believer in human rights and I see LGBT rights as a huge issue in our time. Thus, what are you able to do, if elected another 4 years, to help the LGBT community?

Looking forward to voting for you.
Is it true that Mitt Romney is actually a psyborg sent from the future to eliminate all social services in America in an effort to fund a legion of Paul Ryan attack drones?
Is it really you or one of your staff?
wow this is amazing. 

you have to pick 5 basketball players to make a team. if they lose, the rest of the world declares war on the USA. who do you pick:

a) right now?    
b) in 1992 (dream team era)   
c) 5 years from now
Has the stress of being the president had any effect on your health. You seem to look weathered compared to Obama 2008. Good luck in this years election, I'll be rooting for you.
What is your stance on Net Neutrality? How (if at all) do you plan on enforcing it?
Why allow hemp to be grown in the US.  Way too many years of it being banned.  Fuel, paper, clothes, oil, food.  Need I say more?

Thanks.
I have recently been upgraded to first time father. My Daughter is one month old, and while I feel that I have made great strides and improved my quality of life while you were president. I am very afraid for the future of my daughters adult life. Do you have plans to directly address the massive anti-woman/anti abortion policy surge that has been happening across the nation?
Mr. President, recently the DNC released an ad that takes the Romney quote "I like to be able to fire people that provide services to me," and uses it out of context, to make it seem like he is saying something different. How is this any different from the Romney campaign taking your "you didn't build that" line out of context? It really disheartens me to see the Democrats following the Republicans down this road of being dishonest and misleading. Can you and, if so, will you, put a stop to this practice?
How do you reconcile the diverging results of drug laws such as those in Portugal with those in the US?
Mr President, do you feel that your leadership style and personality traits influence the tone and tenor of our country's culture? If so, what do you do to ensure you project a positive influence?
Do you see an inevitable decline in American influence/soft power in the international system? Why or why not?

2) What is one thing you miss about your life pre-Presidency?

3) Who is your favorite pre-1960 President?

4) What is the best color of Gatorade?

5) Which is your favorite Pokmon?

6) Is your muffin buttered?

How do you think the world will look in 2025 (or even 2050), and how does this affect your plans, policies and ambitions?
No Fucking Way

Mr. President,
Thank you very much for doing this Ask me anything, my question for you relates to you receiving the video game "The Witcher 2" as a gift of diplomacy from Poland... Have you completed the game?
The single biggest hindrance to the success of the up and coming middle class generation can be summarized in two words: student loans.  Many of us are unable to save anything at all after our monthly bill or are running into financial crises trying to make these payments.

Do you have any further plans or measures in mind that will help alleviate this crushing weight on our shoulders and perhaps bring fairness back to the process and rules concerning lending and repayment of student loans?

You symbolize the hope of a new world- the next generation will stand behind you if you give them something to truly believe in.
What has been the most unexpected thing you've learned about your country since you were elected president?
This is the first AMA I actually said "What the fuck, is that real?"

My question: What was it like meeting the Mythbusters?
Do you have a big penis?
Mr. President, do you personally believe corporations are people and should be protected under the Citizen Untied ruling?
I think this is going to break Reddit.
When will you put the effort you showed to get the Obamacare act passed to pass a budget?
Mr. President,
Thank you for this AMA.  My question has to do with America's energy policy.  Wind and Solar energy is shown to be rather inefficient and not cost effective in supplying energy on a large scale.  What is your administration's policy on Nuclear Power?  Nuclear power is highly efficient and can send power to millions relatively cheap compared to wind and solar.  Thank you for taking this question under consideration.
Mr. President, it is an honor to speak with you.  I am a supporter from South Carolina.  I wish you luck with the upcoming election.  I have seen a lot of racism disguised as opposition from a number of people in my State.  That being said, do you think racism has hindered your effectiveness as our President?
Mr. President, I saw you speak in Colorado Springs two weeks ago. Thank you for a wonderful and engaging speech.

During said speech, you very much stressed the importance of education. As someone who is intending to teach for a living, it worries me that the United States is so far behind in several measures of literacy and numeracy. If elected for a second term, what in particular will you do to combat this trend and guide our country towards once again having competitive primary and secondary education?
Do you believe that doing actions such as this AMA will encourage young people to become more involved in the political process?
Serious Question

Mr. President, given the fact that state of the country is not yet where you and I would like to see it, if you do earn a second term, what would be the most important issue on you mind and specifically what would you do to address it?


Not So Serious Question

What is your family's favorite brand of lotion? Never do I see ashy knees anywhere or anytime.
Do you at all regret making such ambitious promises in 2008? 
Do you believe that if you were given another term you could fulfill these promises?
Welcome to the realm of Reddit Mr. President.

I'm a young British teen who caught the politics bug back in your seminal election, 2008, and ever since then every single international election gives me a fever of interest. Many congratulations for your election win and may I wish you a fond fortune for your re-election this November. 

My question to you today sir is what exactly is your stance on internet freedom and censorship? I'm sure you're well informed about the likes of SOPA and PIPA and whatever is clinging to congress this time of year. Do you foresee a need for censorship or is it an infringement on the 225 year old values of the constitution?

Also, as a little bit of a history geek may I ask who is your favourite President?
Boxers or briefs?

It's a matter of national security!
Was there any particular incident that made you change your mind on gay marriage?
Do you prefer Beagles or Bagels?
what's something cool that's not top-super-secret about the white house that most people don't know?
Dear Mr. President,

What is your favorite Pokemon?

Thank you.
What do you think of student loan forgiveness as a way to stimulate the economy and bailout the middle class?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I CAN'T EVEN.

OH GOD I'M HYPERVENTILATING.

I love you.
Mr. President as a Canadian I have great respect for many of your policies and I am optimistic about your efforts to implement a form of National healthcare.

Many Canadians felt that under your predecessor American/Canadian relations were as frosty as they have been in a century.      

My question has to do with our countries mutual interests.  What would you do in your second term to enhance relations with Canada?
Can you reply to this do I can tell everyone Obama talked to me
NIGGER wants to appeal to the faggot liberal hipsters on Reddit so that he can get more votes. Too bad that wont save you. What you fail to understand monkey is that your time will soon be up and  Mitt Romney who is more worthy and more competent will take your place. I pray for that day to arrive quicker. Mitt Romney for president 2012

Mr. President, what are you going to do about marijuana decriminalization/legalization given the growing popular support of these stances and the increased, and very apparent, boon this is to corrupt, dangerous, organized violent drug cartels?
What do you think is the best way to transition from a first-past-the-post system to an alternative method of voting? Which is your favorite? Or, conversely, if you're happy with first-past-the-post, why?

Will you renew your pledge to close Guantanamo?  Is your view of it now  different than what you had while running originally?
My dad met you at Arlington Cemetary earlier this year. I regret not being there with him. 

Have you heard of Lil B? He recently came out with a mixtape called Obama Basedgod. I imagine you rep taskforce.

God. Imagine if, out of all the intelligent comments on this AmA, he answered mine. Thank you President Obama for sticking to the issues.
Many feel the Whitehouse petition web page has failed to meet the promises made at its inception.  Criticisms of government departments are often answered by that department's administration with 'We're doing just fine, thanks' and highly voted petitions have even been removed instead of being answered (most recently, one regarding the TSA).  

What does the Whitehouse plan to do resolve a perception that the petition site represents a broken promise to the electorate?
Mr. President, I humbly request that we completely reform our election process with two clear goals in mind.

1. End all private money flowing into politics.

2. End the two-party system, replacing with a system where third parties have increased relevance.

What are your thoughts on this issue?
Are the rumours of an NSA spy centre being built in Utah to spy on US and non-US citizens true? If so, how can you allow this?

How do you view college degrees, with the downed job market, Is the debt really worth the higher learning, considering even after college, it is still increasingly difficult to find job. 

How do you view colleges in more Socialist countries, such as Norway, where their cost is much more affordable, and do you think that could ever happen in the United States?
Thank you for helping the millions of us without healthcare.
I'm sure many people are asking questions like this but as an undergraduate college student who will be graduating this coming May, what are you doing to help students with loans? I saw a few days ago via your Twitter the loan program you want to put in place. Can you elaborate on this program at all?

Thanks for answering :).

This is (and I think will remain) a very unexpected honour.

An Englishman here, do you have any thoughts towards how a Republican election win might affect the US's international reputation? Is there anything specific (trade deals, bilateral communications, etc.) in your forthcoming policies that demonstrates a more unified international approach?
Like some folks who have already submitted questions, I am a recent law school graduate with a fair amount of debt.  I excelled in law school and am about to become a partner at a smaller firm.  We currently have three attorneys, although we would like to expand to ten.  We cover class action and employment law, but we plan to expand our services to include debtor's rights, family law, and corporate law.

My question is this:  Given the state of student debt and the economy, what will the Obama administration do to help us grow our small, but successful, firm into one that serves even more members of our 1 million strong community?
Why doesn't your office take the online petitions seriously?
Mr President: Former attorney (Sidley, represent!) right here. What are your thoughts on a Constitutional amendment that creates a free and fair federal elections process funded entirely and solely by donations from individual citizens?
Do you take any measures to shield your daughters from how nasty this election campaign is getting (or some of the more extreme attacks you've gotten through the course of your presidency)? I can't even imagine being the subject of such attacks, let alone my children being exposed to it.

EDIT: Also, thank you for doing this. This is absolutely shocking and incredible, good on you for keeping up with modern technology and communication.
What are your religious views?
How big is your penis?
Why are you hating on marijuana worse than the Bush Administration ?
President Obama, I just want to say thank you so much for doing an AMA.

My question is, how has being the President effected the family dynamic in the Obama household? How do your daughters feel about you being President? Do you discuss political issues and campaign plans with them, or do you try to keep things relatively normal?
Thank you so much Mr. President for helping saving my country, Libya. Thank you for your positive attitude and help to the Arab spring in Tunisia, Egypt and Syria. I wish you the best of luck in winning the elections.
Mr. President, I just want to thank you for Obama Care. Because of this program, my father was able to undergo cancer treatment that saved his life. 

Thank you. That is all.
What are your thoughts on the RNC's treatment of the Ron Paul delegates?

Would you support a debate between yourself, Romney, and Gary Johnson?
Best AMA ever.
How did you get so cool?
Election over. Obama on reddit = win.
On a lighter note Mr. President, are you aware of how often you make this face and how much the internet loves it?

When you have your debate at the University of Denver, I would like to have a beer with you afterwards. I live down the street from there and have some of the best American-made craft beer that can be found in the world. 

Can we make that work out?
Spat my tea out when I saw this! Some questions:

* What is your thoughts on the US having a two party system? 
* If (when!) you get re-elected what would your primary goal be to accomplish? 
* Roughly how much time each day do you have for.. well yourself? 
* Roughly how much time do you work every week? 
* Anything fun that you've learned since becoming a President that you don't think most people know (apart from well, Aliens and shit I guess)?.

You've been a huge inspirations to millions out in the world!
Hello Mr. President. 

Hopefully this won't get buried. I work with a group call World in Conversation (worldinconversation.org), and it's our goal to break down social barriers that prevent people from talking about taboo subjects like race, gender, and inequality. 

My question is this: how difficult would it be to implement a small group system within congress, headed by two trained professionals, in which the goal is to increase the amount of rapport and personal relationships on cross party lines?

I've been wondering how long it'd take you to get on reddit. Welcome, and enjoy your AMA. Thank you for your time.
I have to make a presentation about health care in the us (i am german) can you help me?
Mr. President,

Cats or dogs?

Reddit needs to know
Oh god, I was just about to go to bed (Sweden).

Mr President, the person recommending you to do this on Reddit should get a raise. Thank you so much for your time.

The most powerful man on the planet, now on Reddit. Wow.

Nobody in my country can see how you could ever loose to your opposition, but then again we think your opposition are somewhat crazy and you are steering the US to something we Swedes recognize. 

Lots of love from one father to another, let's live for our children.
What do you and your daughters do for fun?
Mr President, what is your fondest childhood memory?
Wow, I am honored. Mr. President Obama, neither candidate has taken a stance on the drug war openly. I want to know what what are your concerns with marijuana, aside from small health risks.  I doubt you'll answer this question but thank you for your time.
The War on Drugs costs this country billions, gives power to the cartels and ruins the lives of non-violent offenders, often at a young age. It's a racist, classist system. Our drugs laws are too strict, the misinformation about drugs is out of control and our we have more incarcerated citizens than any other country. You have only strengthened this war, despite admitting to drug use at a young age. The only difference between you and some of these young black men now caught in this unfair system is that they got caught. If you are re-elected, what will you do in the next four years when it comes to this issue?
Mr. President, 

While the Dow Jones Industrial average is at an all-time high, the majority of the country is still mired in an economic recession.  It seems prices on everything from groceries and gasoline continue to rise, and concurrently job growth is slow, lay-offs are regular and the middle class is getting squeezed out of house and home.  What plans do you have to bring more balance and stability to America's families and workforce?

Thanks!
How does Presidential life differentiate from life before being president?
Sir, I voted for you in 2008. Why on Earth would you sign the National Defense Authorization Act (allowing indefinite detention of US Citizens)? Especially with the final hours of 2011 to go?

I've tried to reason it but I can't. Help shed some light please.
hey, I live in dc and I just turned 21! you ever want to grab a beer or something it's on me.
Mr President, Marvel or DC?
What is your justification for what is, essentially, neutrality in the Syrian conflict? We aren't providing support to the rebels, and it looks like extremist groups are stepping in to fill the leadership void. Is the political capital you're holding onto worth the continued reign of Assad, or the rise of Islamism in Syria? Thanks!
Are you saving all the good stuff for your second term? I'm counting on it, Mr. President.
How do you feel about the corruption that went on at the RNC this week so far, such as taking votes away from states and last minute rules changes to get rid of any dissension?

With our two party political system being as divided as the grand canyon, do you think there is any chance in the future we may become more collaborative and cooperative with each other? All we see on the public side is the hate and division between the two parties which scares us quite frankly. It is no secret that for an effective system to work, you need to be able to work together efficiently without hate for opposing views.  How do you plan to address this as the leader of this great nation?
Hello, Mr. President!

My name is Matt, I'm a teenager, and I am interested in politics. What is one piece of advice you would give to me in order to fulfill any dreams of becoming involved in America's political system when I'm older?

Thank you (Keep up the good work)!

I know it isn't likely that you'll read this, but it would mean a whole lot if you do!
What do you plan to do about our broken patent system as it pertains to software?
As much as you and I may disagree on many issues, we have the same ultimate goal: to make the US an awesome place to be. I respect you and your office and the Greater Good Things the country has done under your leadership, even if I don't always believe they were implemented within the bounds of my own political philosophy and ideas of the role of government.

**With the idea of the role of government in mind, what can Americans do, or what can their government do, to further espouse a culture of volunteer charity outside the framework most commonly provided by religious organizations or cultural/nationality-based organizations?** 

I ask because I believe that charity by force, e.g. taking taxes from one person in order to provide income to others, creates a resentment that is untenable in the long run. I recognize that inherent greed prevents some from giving more of themselves and/or their means in charitable ways, but I also believe that it is possible, over time, to steer our culture in a direction where folks give more freely of themselves without the need for government to get in the way.

**Regardless of your answer, if you address my question at all, I thank you for spending time on our little piece of the Internet.**
If I showed up at the White House gates, would you let me come in and bro out? Maybe play some CoD, Minecraft, or Mario?
There are a lot of people in my synagogue who question your support for Israel. They say you would cut off support to Israel. Where do you stand as far as your support for Israel?

Also, and this is not entirely related, but I have been a supporter of yours since 2007. In February I gave my then girlfriend (now wife) a Valentine's Day card that had a photo of you on it that said "Make sure to vote for me next year!" She did. Thanks for coming to Reddit!
Mr. President,

How do you feel about the ever growing state of the Federal government and the idea that the long held constitutional notion of states rights is quickly fading while the Federal government gains more power.

Many of the issues presented to you on a daily basis are ones that historically would have been left to the states to decide, yet daily the Federal government is taking on more roles than was ever intended by the constitution. 

In a country where mobility is much greater than it ever has been in the history of humanity, why is the Federal government impeding on states rights when it has never been easier for citizens to find a state with their political ideals?
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to do this, Mr. President.  My question has to do with those of us who are underwater with their mortgages, but unable to take advantage of any of the current government plans.  I'm able to pay my mortgage every month, I've never been late, yet I cannot refinance because I'm almost $100K underwater.  My loan is owned by a small local bank because it is has an adjustable rate.  Were it a fixed rate, it would be easy for me to refinance.  Are there any plans to help the millions of homeowners in my situation?

Regardless of your answer to this question, you have my vote.  I live in MA and want nothing more than to see Mitt Romney sent packing.

Edit: Grammar.  Good Lord, I wouldn't want the President thinking I don't know proper grammar.
Hello President Obama, I supported you in 2008 and will support you in 2012. My question to you is what can we do as American citizens to help urge Congress to close Guantanamo Bay? Also, are you a Stout man or an Ale man?
Mr. President,

First off, wow thank you for doing this. Now onto the question. One of the reasons I voted for you last election was that I am a traveling salesman that spends a lot of time on the road, and thus the infrastructure of the country is pretty important to me.  You had plans to improve the infrastructure of the United States, and I know some of the bail out money was wisely used to improve some infrastructure, but I feel like it was sadly inadequate. Do you have any plans in the future to push hard for a massive update to a system that is now approaching 40 years old? Would that be part of your second term plans?
Mr. President, The hugely unpopular Citizens United ruling has taken yet another step into poisoning free and fair elections. Money is flooding the elections. I understand the in order to get elected these days one must utilize the Super PACs. If elected what will you do to get money out of politics?
What is your proudest achievement as president?
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the stimulus package) was a limited success, (of course, we don't know what it could have saved us from.)
1. Knowing what you do now, what would you have done differently? More spending? Less spending? Different areas of spending?
2. To what degree did the enacted bill match your original goal for the bill. How much did you have to compromise?
Can you please speak to why private industries like big content are being allowed to utilize Govt resources to act as their personal police force and why their interests are being pressed world wide so they do not have to innovate and compete in the marketplace? 

I realize that Big Content has been a major campaign contributor for you, however I find it offensive that you would use the youth to gain office and then spend your entire term trying to criminalize them to prop up an outdated industry who refuses to innovate and compete in the marketplace. I also don't understand why US Foreign Policy is being manipulated through campaign dollars to prop up foreign companies like Gucci, LV, the record labels (all 3 majors are foreign) and the Movie industry. 

I'm asking this as someone who's been directly affected by your Administrations handling of these issues when a domain I'm associated with was wrongly seized for over a year before being handed back without so much as an explanation or an apology. 

I'd like to remind you that you represent the people Mr. President... Not Hollywood. 
Thank You
What is your stance on the recent cases of so-called "patent trolling" and this whole Samsung vs Apple fiasco?

Software patents, which are an important part of these cases, are not permitted in the EU for a good reason, any thoughts on them? 
Is the reform of the patent system needed?
Mr. President, I am a high school senior facing te college application process. Chances are I will have large amounts of debt after college or may not even be able to attend certain colleges due to my inability to pay. While there are several students that will get large scholarships due to athletics or extraordinary academics, I am a perfectly ordinary student and will not likely get a large scholarship. There are several students like me who put all the effort they can into school, but still don't qualify for large scholarships and have to shoulder the burden of an education that costs often over $120,000. I understand that education is an important issue for you, how will you make sure that hard working, middle-of-the-road students can afford a decent college education?
this is pretty fucking awesome, good job reddit!
Polls show that more than half of all Americans support the legalization of cannabis, to be sold, taxed, and regulated in a manner similar to alcohol. Since cannabis has been proven to be a safe drug, even having positive medicinal effects for a wide variety of ailments. In fact, the worst thing that can happen from the possession or consumption of cannabis is getting arrested. Frankly sir, the war on drugs has been a complete failure, a waste of taxpayer dollars, ad has ruined countless innocent lives. And here's the thing: people won't stop smoking weed. Because that's part of what freedom is. The freedom of choice to experiment with our own consciousness. So my question is this: why are you still waging this pointless war?
Mr. President, I'm not American but I'd like you to know my countrymen like you more than any US president in the last 50 years. Unfortunately we're not the ones voting.
President Obama.  Wow, never thought I'd have even a slight (getting slighter chance) of having any form of contact with you.  My question will not be a popular one.  Why did you cave on the healthcare bill?  You didn't give us (the millions of uninsured) a real viable option for taking care of ourselves.  I voted for you with the belief in change, meaning I believed in you.  On the campaign trail you seemed so fiery and made it so easy to believe this wouldn't be a business as usual type of presidency.  However, since then, it's been nothing but partisan caving and trying to get the two sides to get along.  Why haven't you used your power and prestige to actually legitimately change the United States?  Who cares if the conservatives disagree, this was your chance to make the difference that needed to be made.  The mere fact that polls have you neck and neck with a guy like Mitt Romney is a sign of how disillusioned your presidency has made the rest of the population that backed you so hard during the 2008 election.  I think you're squandering an opportunity to instead of just being remembered as the first black president, but to be remembered as the guy who came in and actually did his job.  Representing the American people who need help the most.  I know it doesn't matter what one person says, but seriously Mr. President.  It's time you follow through on your promises.  Make history not complacency.
Working in the financial industry, I'm amazed at how the tax code is written in favor of the wealthy.  Realistically, what needs to happen in congress or elsewhere for us to close some of the loopholes and make a more balanced tax plan?
Hi President Obama. Apparently Rush Limbaugh thinks you can control the weather just like Storm can. So who is your favorite superhero?
Why are you continuing the senseless War on Drugs? 

 This country is counting on you, you know its a problem, you've promised to get rid of it, yet you've thrown more money at it than any previous president and your administration is actively working on perpetuating this awful and embarrassing mess.  Frankly, it could be renamed "The War on Reason and Science."

Why?
What makes the United States the greatest country on Earth?
Are you planning on doing anything about current patent law.  In particular that of computer software and hardware that seems to patent "Common sense"  information
Mr. President! What do you do for fun?
Favorite movie of all time.
Hi Mr. President, I want to ask about the precedent you are setting regarding executive power. So far, drone strikes ordered by you and your agencies have killed more than 3500 people in the border regions of Pakistan, and at least some of these strikes are based on no more evidence than the profiling of people in that region. In effect, as president you have claimed the power to order the death of more people than were killed on September 11, while presenting no evidence to any independent civil magistrate. You have even approved the killing of American citizens in Yemen, based on nothing more than their relation to a terrorist suspect. (See http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18896232). 

I support most of your domestic initiatives and I am leaning toward voting for your reelection. However, I fear that your actions in this arena have set a dangerous precedent for future presidents and the future of American liberty. No president deserves to hold such power to decide who lives and dies, and the Judicial branch of government exists for a reason.
Mr. President: Boxers, or briefs?
Thank you for being here. Reddit is a has many aspects that are truly benificial to individuals in our connected world. What revolutionary ways can society adapt using this type of forum. (accredited education? More weight in federal reccognition of cultural and global diversity?)
President Obama, 

As a proud American and I am asking that you support my rights to play poker on the internet. Please work with Congress to pass sensible legislation to license and regulate online poker in the United States.  This will provide the consumer safety we need in this country while allowing adult Americans the freedom to play this great American game.  It is simply the right thing to do for this Congress. 

Will you support this?

Dear Barrack Obama,

My parents would like to know why you signed a bill that allows the indefinite jail of Americans. Before you signed this bill on December 31st, Americans had to freed from jail 24 hours after being arrested, after you signed this bill Americans can be held for up to 7 years without trial. I hope you answer this and I wish you the best of luck in the upcoming election.
Hi Mr. President! I am very excited for you to be reelected this November. What will you do in the next four years to reduce the problem of gun violence throughout the country, especially in urban areas like your hometown of Chicago?
You should come visit the University of Georgia; we would love to have you! Thanks!
The Republicans are campaigning on a constitutional amendment against same sex marriage.

Would you campaign on a constitutional amendment to ban corporate (unnatural persons) financing of elections to overturn Citizens United? 

I'm doubtful the President has direct power to make that happen, but you could threaten to withhold transfer payments to States that did not ratify the amendment.
Hi Mr. President,

When you're not busy being the President, what do you do? Hang out with your family? Watch TV? Sleep? Ponder the enormity of being the leader of the Free World?
If you're re-elected, are you going to work to bring full marriage equality to the United States?
"Marijuana prohibition has resulted in the arrest of over 20 million Americans since 1965, countless lives ruined and hundreds of billions of tax dollars squandered and yet this policy has still failed to achieve its stated goals of lowering use rates, limiting the drugs access, and creating safer communities.

Isnt it time to legalize and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol? If not, please explain why you feel that the continued criminalization of cannabis will achieve the results in the future that it has never achieved in the past?"
Mr. Obama, 

I'm 23, and I make a little extra money every two weeks because I'm lucky enough to be covered under my Father's health insurance plan. Thank you for that, and thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. 

Here's my question (hopefully it's not too long winded) -- Last night, Gov. Christie made what struck me as a very divisive speech. He was critical of public school teachers and unionized workers, and he referred to the parties as "us" and "them." I know the goal is bipartisanship and that it's absolutely necessary for a healthy democracy, but how do you work with a party who so clearly wants you to fail? Who are the leaders among conservatives who you think break that mold?

Thank you again, and for what it's worth, I'm with you.
Have you ever posted on reddit anonymously?
Does it bother you that the super wealthy corporations have a much bigger say in how our country operates than the people do? 

If so, do you have any plans to make changes in your current or pretty-much-guaranteed next term in order to either reduce their power, or increase our power?
Mr. President, how do you deal with Saudi Arabia?

Will you work on making a clearer link between terrorism and energy policy? (i.e. dependence on Saudi Arabia for oil)

Bin Laden was from there, 16 of 19 9/11 hijackers were from there, they're still exporting Wahhabist ideology to AfPak and elsewhere, and this isn't just a problem with the government but of the public there as well (I grew up there).

Thank you, and good luck this November!
What is your favourite song and why?
Mr. President, what exactly is your take on the National Defense Authorization Act? What were your reasons for signing it, and how do you justify giving our government the power to ignore the 5th amendment and impede upon due process even more, despite the fact that innocent people inadvertently getting into trouble is always a possibility?
Any more funding for the NASA program?
My questions deal with Drug reform:

What are your reasons for continuing to ban Marijuana? Would you ever consider abolishing the prohibition on Marijuana and making it a commercial substance like Alcohol? 

And I have to ask, you're a home brewer; would you ever post or mind revealing the recipe for the White House Honey Ale?

As a gay veteran, thank you for your support!
your economic advisers are banking industry insiders from the same institutions as those who pressured clinton to repeal glass-steagall, and pressured bush and yourself to bail them out.

I feel absolutely powerless when it comes time to vote as my choices are often between one seemingly corrupt politician vs the other party's corrupt politician.  

What do you suggest I do?
Mr. President~ I'm 36 yrs old and I've been out of work since graduating from college two years ago. Because of this employment gap in my resume, it's hard to get my foot in the door with perspective employers. While, the economy is picking up, there's thousands of people in my position. Luckily, my wife is working and that is how we are surviving. 

If, we give you a democratically controlled House and Senate, what action can we see from the White House, and Congress to address this employment crisis? Are there any plans for a CCC type of jobs program, if you win a second term? 

Thank you for your time. Good Luck in Nov, were counting on you.
Being in the scientific field, I have witnessed many researchers go abroad to continue their work due to a severe lack of grant funding in the USA. This leads to great minds leaving the country and with them, innovation and knowledge drain. Will NIH be getting some help?
Mr. President, I'm very upset with many of the things that have occurred these past four years...or should I say haven't. When are you planning to take action on global warming and our dependence on oil? When will you start putting more emphasis on education, healthcare (the important aspects of health care, i.e. availability), and the environment? We are entering into a detrimental state in our history, the environment is becoming more drastic in weather patterns, we are going to be having issues feeding ourselves soon and our fresh water supplies will be becoming more and more difficult to obtain. In this day and age, we need to be putting more money into our education (both secondary and universities), scientific research for alternative and sustainable energy resources (not just for energy supply but transportation as well, i.e. implementing a national railway system, less cars on the road, more public transportation, habitat restoration, soil restoration and water conservation), a healthcare program that is actually available to everyone without Forcing people to apply for it, and more focus on the environment, with more pressure on the corporations adding harmful toxins into our air and holding them accountable for their actions. Less emphasis needs to be take from the military and put to the actual needs of our people. As the next term comes up, are you willing to address these issues as they are well over do to be addressed.
OH MY GOD! Hello, Mr. President. How are you doing today?
Mr. President, 

    I am a senior college student at The Ohio State University and I could like to say thank you very much for taking the time out of your day to make yourself available to us normal citizens.  This is a once in a life time opportunity for many of us and it is truly an honor to be addressing you, even if it is through the interent.  As a student nearing the end of my college career, I woud like to know what your outlook on the job market is and if you have any reform ideas that could help improve the job situation for young people.  Thank you for your time.

Im a 24 year old male. Fresh out of college with an engineering degree ready to make my mark on the world. Any general advice on what someone like me can do to try and change the world?
Will you address America's growing concern with the Federal Reserve and the long-term effects that reserve banking has had (and continues to have) on our economy?
Hi President Obama!  Had a few quick questions.  Some serious, some not so much.  Answer whatever you like.  

1.  What's your favorite movie?

2.  What's your favorite book?  

3.  What's on the top of your agenda if you get elected for a second term?  If you had to pick one policy issue or stance that you wish everyone could agree with, what would it be?     

4.  Favorite record/album?   Why?

5.  Between the Tea Party, Ron Paul's supporters and Occupy movements, what do you think this means for the state of American politics in the future?  Do you personally think running for President should remain essentially the same (by amassing tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to run, and all the strings that come attached with that support, implicit and explicit), or do you think some kind of top-down reform is necessary in the long-run?  Do you at least agree, in principle, that the election system as it exists today leaves too many opportunities for corruption?  Can this be changed, do you think?    

Thanks in advance.
Mr. Obama,

In your opinion, what is the hardest part of your job as the president of the United States of America?
How do you feel about breaking Reddit and reducing productivity of most businesses by a significant amount today?
Mr. President, my biggest concern with your administration is how you've taken the power to kill american citizens like Anwar Al-Awlaki without submitting the decision to any kind of judicial review.  

Putting aside the particular details of Al-Awlaki's case, can you elaborate on why you think the President should have this kind of power?
[Bold proposal here: make NASA's budget 1 penny of our dollar.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o)
Please comment on plans for universal health care and the role of the community hospital.  You were recently in NH speaking about a quarter mile from a 100 bed hospital.  A large area depends on this small hospital, but government program health payments do not support the cost of care/medications/equipment.  We want universal health care, but is it necessary to pay out less than commercial insurance?  How can small hospitals in rural communities survive?  When can the health of our citizens demand the premium that farming, the military etc receives?  Thank you!!!!!
Why did you put through the indefinite detention bill?
Hello Mr. President! I know most of the questions will be regarding politics here, but I want to know; what career(s) did you want to go into when you were a child? Before you got into law, politics, and being the President.

I hope the trolls flooding in from 4chan don't bring down reddit so you can do this. Thank you for taking the time for this! :)
Mr. President, you and your wife went to Harvard 20 years ago when the costs were under $20,000 a year. Now it's more than twice that, beating inflation and cost of living adjustments significantly. 

You didn't pay your loans off until you wrote a best selling book. Yet now the costs are twice what took you and your wife, both quite successful people, more than 15 years to pay off. 

What help can we look forward too?

Furthermore, a specific issue I feel obligated to point out is how federal loans may driving up the cost of education. When every school can charge what they want rather than what they need, and the government will loan the money, we're getting massive amounts of schools hurting their students. 

This goes the entire spectrum. From questionable vocational schools with poor job placement rates getting their students 20k in debt, to law schools with employment rates less than 20% getting their students in 200k of debt. 

Mr. President, we're drowning in debt, and there needs to be an investigation into how to fix this.
How can we ever hope, as individual citizens with limited funds, to have a real voice in our government now that corporations are protected as "citizens" and permitted to spend unlimited funds on elections?
What is the most frustrating aspect about working with/talking to US media outlets? Do you notice a difference between US and Foreign media outlets? Which differences?
Mr. President, it is a pleasure and honor for you to speak with us. Thank you for taking the time out of your insanely busy schedule. 

If you get a second term, do you have any plans for the student debt/education crisis? We are suffering through corruption and lies, drowning in insanely high interest rates and payments, and getting harassed by vultures of private loans. My husband and I have always loved school and wished to continue our education for many years. But due to these loans we cannot do so and actually regret furthering my education. When it is all said and done, from the $200 between us, I'm sure the final payback will be double that, at least. Please help us students. Sincerely, Samantha.
Mr. President, I have no questions just wanted express my complete admiration & respect I have for the exuberant poise & leadership that you have had while in office during our countries recent difficult times. You have carried such a heavy burden on your shoulders & have done is so selflessly that all I can really say is thank you!
Thank for giving us your time Mr. Obama. I know it will be difficult to give everyone an answer (due to the sheer amount of questions), but I hope you might answer mine. I am a college student in Washington state, and my question is: what actions have you taken to lower the price of tuition for colleges in universities or to make financial aid more attainable?
Did the president just break reddit?
The President of the United States does AMA on Reddit. The **least** we can do is get out there and vote on election day.
Mr. President.  Returning the government to the people should be the most important item.  I see 2 things that need to happen:
1. Term limits for members of Congress.  Return to the ideals of private citizens serving publicly and then returning to private life, no more career politicians!
2. Overhaul of Campaign Financing, no more super pacs, limits to what individuals can spend and corporations ARE NOT people.
Please let us know if these or similar items are important for you and your platform?
Just a few questions...

1. What's up with the drone strikes in different countries? Such as Yemen, where a young american citizen was killed.

2. Why did you sign NDAA? 

3. Why do you still support the Patriot act?
How do you reconcile being a black man and supporting the war on drugs, something that unfairly and disproportionately negatively affects minorities especially blacks?
Barack what were you thinking when you let the NDAA go through? Do you really think the military should be able to treat America like if it was nazi Germany? Unless you know the shits going to hit the fan Whats the reasoning behind this? 

Do you believe you deserve the Nobel peace prize when you haven't spread contributed to peace and have sent out drone attacks with your own personal kill list?

And one last question, can you PLEASE check out a song by a foundation that spreads education to children called "smoking weed with the president" by prince ea. ignore the name and please adress the issue.



One last question
How do you justify drone attacks in Pakistan? As a Pakistani I see them as highly counter-productive to the objectives of both your country and mine. They kill more civilians then terrorist targets. In a region where revenge is a matter of family pride, they ultimately result in thousands of new recruits for the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan). Who in reply to us supporting your war efforts attack our people and have thus far killed 40,000+ Pakistanis.
In to be a part of history!
Please, Mr. President.  Talk about the pot policies.  It's not fair and it should be my choice.  Please, please don't avoid this issue.  It will seriously lock up the election for you overnight.
The crisis of climate change is still being questioned and debated while the timescale for necessary action continues to dwindle. The partisanship and polarity of the congress has neutered regulatory legislation in terms of both climate change and environment devastation mitigation.
What will you do to bring forth a bipartisan movement for the long-term survival of our civilization?
 A healthy environment (and thus a healthy human population) should not be bound by politic.
Who do you think will win the NBA championship this upcoming season?
As a candidate how do you deal with or respond to the obvious lies and misinformation in today's media? I say obvious, however there is misinformation being spread that the less informed American flat out believes. I know it's the people's responsibility to be informed of the decisions they make, but I get so frustrated with the brick wall in front of progress due to misinformation and corruption in the media.
When will you close Guantanamo Bay? Is it true that you are  passively condoning enhanced interrogation techniques (torture) and extraordinary rendition (outsourcing torture)? These are just lies, right? I mean, you are one of the good guys!

And these drone signature strikes, is it true that any military aged male is automatically considered an enemy combatant unless exhumed after they are dead? 

Am I being registered on some list as we speak for asking these questions? I really hope not. I'm a nice person, never hurt anyone.
Hello Mr President!

You Rock! Also, whats your favorite thing to do as the President [not business related]?
If you were a farmer at *least* 500 years ago in any historical civilization, with both livestock and crops, what civilization would you want to be a farmer in and why?
Wow. It's an honor just to post in a thread that the President knows about.
Anyways, by some miracle in which this post is viewed within the 6000 comments, I do have a question. 

I love the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As a med student, and family members within the medical community, this is a very good step forward. There is, however, still some problems with the wording, such as payment to physicians by quality (which starts in a few years, 2015 I believe). How do you fairly judge this, especially with the variables of patients not necessarily following orders? 

Thank you, and good day!
You were amazing on the campaign trail in 2008.  We, together as a nation, were going to fix **everything**.  I was really proud to be an American because I felt like my leader was really on equal standing with the rest of us.  You understood the problems and were going to set things straight.

I have a million things I want to ask you, a lot of commentary too but I think I'll narrow it down to this:  What stopped us from creating a single payer health care system?
President Obama, as others here have said, thank you for taking the time out of your clearly busy schedule to do this AMA. 

What is your personal response to the criticism and blatant insults that Mitt Romney and other Republicans have attacked you with? Even though you probably would avoid talking about this in a press/media setting, your personal thoughts would be much appreciated. 

Again, thank you for doing this.
Dear Mr. President:

I am extremely proud to call you my President, if only because you have been gracious and noble in the face of the most repugnant personal attacks on you, your race, your religion, your party, and everything else that you ostensibly hold dear.  Your campaign and subsequent election  has since revealed this very, very ugly side to the Country we both call home -- and the Country you are charged with leading.  Which leads to two questions:

Why not go in front of the American people, and say

 ***"I am sorry for what I have done wrong, and I ask for your forgiveness.  To those who have done wrong -- to me, my family, my race, my religion, my party, my Country -- I sincerely forgive you."***
  
What better way to kick start a genuine reconciliation in America that we desperately need to allow us to live up to the ideals that we all believe in?
Instead of rescuing "too big to fail" banks, why didn't you focus more on the middle class homeowners who got swindled by them?
Legalize it
Hey Obama and thanks for doing this :)

What's up?
Mr. President, now that Obama Bin Laden is dead, how will the United States transition to peacetime? Is the War on Terror something that can ever end, or will our armed forces be forever locked in conflict with a faceless foreign enemy?
I don't mean any disrespect, but I doubt you are going to answer many questions when answering in the language of politics. As in a decent amount of fluff in all of the answers.
Mr Obama, could you tell us what you're going to do with the Syrian situation?

Innocent people are being massacred, these are not the times to be sitting idly by. The international community needs strong action from a world superpower.
Do you think government should play more or less of a role in the lives of American people than it currently does?
I am a student on Long Island going into my junior year. Going for a B.M. in Music Education. I am sure there are already many comments and questions like mine. Over 3/4 of my friends who are education majors who have graduated currently are either unemployed, work retail, or teach something completely unrelated to music on a part time basis, and are in constant fear of being terminated. 

We are all thousands of dollars in debt due to student loans, much like many of the people posting on here. The interest rate on student loans are worse than theft, almost as if it's a joke.

I am registered to the Republican party, and quite frankly, I'm embarrassed to be registered to any party at this point. Politicians don't care about anyone but themselves. I used to enjoy politics, but now talking it is just a waste.

My question, like many others, is what will be done about the ridiculous costs to attend a private college and the ridiculous interest rate on student loans that is attached to that? How will I know I'll be able to find a job, and support myself and a future family? It hasn't looked very promising the last several years.
What was the most exciting moment of the your time in office?
What's your favorite television show?
Barack Obama, I love what you stand for and will vote for you. However, I feel as if you are a person who traverses through politics with the intention of negiotiating and compromise. I believe it is the way true democracy works, but your peers and others in the government don't want to compromise. Is this true? How severe and difficult is this?
Do you have any plans to work towards shrinking the income gap between the economic classes (low, middle and upper) in the US?
One of your biggest promises from 2008 was bringing the troops home from Iraq. Would you consider making a similar promise this time around? I would like to see troops from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and all over the middle east come home. End the globalization of this country and stop spending money (read: collecting debt) on overseas actions. Millions spent on an Iraq embassy? How can you justify that kind of spending in times like these?
Thank you for doing this iama. Do you ever regret your decision to run for President the first time around? I'm just curious because it seems like President of the US of A might just be the most stressful job ever. I admire you, but I'd never want to be in your shoes.
I think you should run a super straight forward ad campaign that says, "hey America, do you make less than 200 thousand dollars a year?  If so, vote for Obama...  The other guy really doesn't care about you.". (something along those lines..)  Thoughts?
Mr. President, many of us have grave concerns about the nature of the drone program, especially since some of the program is run under the CIA - which is a civilian program - have you considered making the drone program, which has been quite effective at decimating terrorist networks, more open to the public and oversight?
All I want for my 22nd birthday is a reply from you Mr. Obama!! 

Also thank you for treating everyone out there equal. politicians who want to decrease other human's rights sicken me.
What is your plan to get America back on track, and in the forefront of production compared with other countries, such as more oil, renewable energy, or better use of technology?
President Obama,
Let me first off thank you for giving us this opportunity to ask you questions. With that said, on to my question.

Mr.President, what is your honest opinion on the GOP's treatment of Ron Paul's delegates throughout the election season, and especially within recent days with the RNC in full force now? Do you believe that Romney perhaps got the nomination unfairly? Thank you.
Mr. President, what's your favorite tie that you own? Would you ever consider wearing a bow tie to a formal event?
With the mishandling of TARP funds by the recipients, the horrific LIBOR debacle and it's effects here in the US and the non-prosecution of Goldman Sachs for its fraud (Including the Hudson transaction with Morgan Stanly), it seems the banking industry is out of control. What is being done to make sure the banking industry can no longer harm the American taxpayers?
I don't have a question, I just want to thank you for doing this Mr. President.
these drone attacks in Pakistan, are they legal? Who is US killing? Do they deserve due process?
Does Mrs. Obama have a pet name for you?
There is a lot invested into drones, why do you feel that this is better than sending troops out to countries? Will these drones be able to prevent innocent people from being killed in the process?
I'm a proud Obama supporter, I believe you're exactly what the US needs <3 thank you Obama for remembering the low income families and women <3 ILY
So I'm borrowing from a movie that isn't very good, but just a reminder:

"Nicolas Cage: ...you're the president of the United States, sir. Whether by innate character, or the oath you took to defend the Constitution, or the weight of history that falls upon you. I believe you to be an honorable man, sir.

The President: People don't believe that stuff anymore.
 
Nicolas Cage: They want to believe it."

It's no good to try to restore our faith in government without restoring our faith in the people who run that government.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, is a great step forward in health care for the millions of uninsured Americans, and Americans with preexisting conditions.  Is there anything else you would like to do to improve health care in America?  Anything to address skyrocketing costs?
Do you ever get time to kick back and enjoy a brew? If so, what's your favorite?
I would love to know how you will continue to support homosexuals and women's rights to choose abortion or to keep their child. As an advocate for homosexuals, even though I'm not gay myself, and as a woman who is pro-choice, I would like to hear more of your plan!

I'm supporting you all the way!!
How do you balance the roles of world leader and American president?
How does it feel to crash reddit, Mr. President?
Hi Mr. President, 

I know this is a long shot at best, but it would be an honor if you would listen to my band. Please and thank you in advance, and it's truly awesome you're here on Reddit.

What's the first thing you said when you guys took out Osama bin Laden?
Dear Mr President, 

Thanks for doing this. 

My question for you is for all the UK redditors out there.

How do you see the stance of the UK within global politics in the next 50years given that we are no longer the economic power house we used to be?
Every job comes with some stereotypical assumption about what it is they can do, ("Oh, you work in software, can you fix my computer!") and I imagine yours is no different ;)  What are you most frequently asked or expected to do that is completely out of the scope of your job?
As geek (or nerd) in Chief, are there any future goals for the american space program that really interest you? A hypothetical man on Mars for example or an exploration of Titan or Europa for life.

Also, Star Trek or Star Wars?
This is not a question but I just want to say how much I admire your moral compass. The reason I will be voting for you in November has nothing to do with fiscal policies but because you truly exemplify the unbiased attitude that a President of the United States should have towards Americans of all gender, religion, and social class. Your opponents, not so much. Thank you.
Hi President Obama! I am a recent graduate of UIC, and I have to know, where was your favorite place to eat when you lived in Chicago?
Mr. President, 
Can you tell us a bit about your background and why you became interested in politics?
President Obama, a Redditor?  This act alone may get me to vote for him instead of who I was going to vote for.
If you had your choice for opponent, who would you choose simply because you think they would be a worthy presidential nomination?

Ignoring party affiliations and chances to win.

If not you, who would you vote for and why?

Not on the topic of politics, but all time favorite movie scene?
Wow, I just have to ask: As a musician myself, what music do you like? What music makes you feel great and ready to take on any challenges as president?
Mr. Obama: What do you know about Nikola Tesla?
Why should I believe that the government can more effectively spend my money than I can?
Thank you Mr. President for doing this. Thank you also for passing the Health Care reforms in your last term. As a college student of non-wealthy parents it affected me and others directly in a possitive way. What legislation would you attempt to get through congress if the democrats had another super majority.
When will we see US involvement regarding the situation in Syria?  You had important measures to take during the Jasmine Revolution by sending US NATO forces to Libya.  Syria is in need of support.  
Can we expect to see more troops being brought home from Afghanistan and Iraq?
I dont have any questions that others probably wont ask.. but if you could respond to this it would... be the most awesome thing ever
How much free time do actually have,    Mr.President?
How often are you able to enjoy the amenities of the White House (e.g. bowling alley, swimming pool, movie theater)?
This is so cool!
*Star Wars* or *Star Trek*?
When will the tax loopholes and offshore safehavens be closed? The amount of untaxed money that's getting siphoned out of our economy by the elites is absolutely obscene. When will the madness stop? What is your plan for getting such legislation through congress?
Hello Mr. President. 

Will you be legalizing weed soon?

thank you
- cwiz
Mr. President, with so many wealthy politicians in Congress (read: those in the 1%), what assurances do we have that they, and you, are fighting for what's right and what's best for this country (even if it comes at your own personal loss or sacrifice)?
Do you plan to increase spending more money on infrastructure to help improve our old roads and public transportation which in turn would help with our reliance on oil.
How do you like your job?
As someone from Holland with less than basic knowledge about the political system in America, I would just like to say that of all the president candidates I've seen, you seemed the most sane one (Because, you know, not sent by god, able to provide your tax reports etc.)
Welcome to the reddit community mister president. I just wanted to ask what are the best ways to get involved in the upcoming election and politics in general? What can we personally and reddit as a whole do to help you (aside from voting, of course) in the upcoming election? Thanks! Hopefully you'll see this.
Why hasn't your campaign pressed your opponent on why he would like to "even the playing field" when it comes to wind/solar power subsidies, but has said that he would keep all subsidies on oil and gas power. I would understand the argument for "free market" but this seems like a glaring issue on his part and your campaign has not said a peep about it. 

Push this point, sir. Push it good.
Even if Romney wasn't a complete tool, this right here would secure my vote for Obama.
With the election approaching and your current duties as President, how do you find time for yourself and you family and what do you do with that precious free time you get?
Mr. President... I am an undecided voter...  What do you think the biggest reason I should vote for you is?  

Thanks for doing this!  It is awesome to see you on this!
How is your day/week going?
Do you have a plan of inspiring students to go into the STEM field?  Having just graduated back in may with a degree in engineering, it is upsetting to see such few people going into this field to keep the USA on top as the best place in the world for technology.  What do you see as a Sputnik Moment to get students interested and actually perusing these fields?
What is your stance on the cost of education in America today? Specifically higher education involving both the public and private sectors. My roommate and long-time friend has been in a situation of limbo that is currently putting his future in jeopardy. This individual works two jobs, files his own taxes, pays his own rent, and is still not recognized as an independent due to the rules and regulations set fourth FAFSA and the board of education. Thusly, this has left my friend with a tuition bill that he, like many others in his position, can't afford. This now places both the possibility of attaining a degree and succeeding past the high school education level in peril. As a 20 year old University student based in Washington DC (George Washington University) it leaves me with a lack of faith in the education system in America. How does your administration, and more importantly yourself, feel about the idea that our nation's up and coming leaders may be left with an inadequate education due to financial restrictions and regulations barring us from finishing our stay at University.
The tax payers bailed out the banks and the banks suffered no consequences. Now banks make it extremely difficult for tax payers to get mortgage loans, even on government owned and bank owned properties. What will you do to get the reak estate market moving again? Interest rates arent helping.
Stephen Colbert or Jon Stewart?
What is your favorite ice cream flavor?
Are you disappointed in the quality of the candidates the RNC has produced and how do you feel about the RNC systematically shutting down Ron Paul and his supporters.
Mr President, why did you decide to enter politics? Now that you have got to a level of power, do you think you are achieving what you originally went into politics to do? What do you think are your priorities to get there if re-elected? Which i hope you are!
mr. president, this may be my only opportunity to ever come in contact with you, so I'd like to ask: What's your favorite album? I know it's sort of mundane, but I'd like to know.
What teams do you think have the best chance of winning the NBA and NCAA basketball championships?
This has gotten out of hand..... But I support you full sir Obama

Is there time for you to come visit the middle of America while on your campaign tour? We would love to see you in Hastings Nebraska, and I would be happy to trade homebrew recipes. There's still hope here!
Mr. President, if you were to get re-elected for a second term. What are your goals to make this country better by 2016? Also, why was funding for NASA cut? And when can we expect funding for a manned mission to mars?
First of all thank you, Mr. President, for doing this.

Now, I'm not from the USA, I'm British, but I still take a big interest in US politics(and whole World politics). I think the US gets a bad rap from pretty much every other country, including mine. Honestly, I think your party and how you've held Office has been one of the best in my lifetime (I'm 20 years old, btw).

My question, finally, is do you think the US(since it's founding) has had maybe too much involvement in the affairs of other countries, and do you think many Americans, even if not Government, think themselves like a World Police?
Mr. President,

The Supreme Court has become markedly more conservative and in my opnion less concerned about stare decisis.  What major precedents, if any, do you believe are in danger of being overturned due to the shift in ideology on the Court?

By the way, you totally rock for doing this.
Mr. President, can you speak to plans for working with Congress to provide a balanced budget within the next four years if you're re-elected?
From a Canadian:

What is it really like to work with Stephen Harper?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Mr.Obama,

Since what age have you been professionally involved in politics and have you always wanted to be a politician.
Mr. President, what is a single piece of good advice you would give a young person of this generation?
How's quitting smoking going? I'm having a hard time myself and I don't have nearly the stress in my life that you do.
President Obama, what is your opinion on life outside of this solar system we call home? I'm not suggesting we have been visited but do you think life is out there besides what we find on Earth? How complex do you think it might be? Do you get to spend any time looking up toward the stars?  You're a super cool dude! Keep on being awesome.
Hi I'm a student at University of North Carolina at Asheville. I registered 75 voters in 2 hours just so I could get a ticket for the convention. 
Will you come to Asheville so I can buy you a plate of ribs at 12 Bones? I hear its your favorite.
how do you feel about the birthers? it's easily the most absurd thing i've ever heard of. they do a background check for you to work at a mcdonalds, i figured president would be a little bit more expansive?
What was the one moment in your life that you decided you wanted to become President of the United States?
When are you going to take the gloves off and start beating your lying, not-honorable-at-all opponents back into the stone age where they belong?  

We know you can kick their butts when you want to.  Can you get on that for us?
Mr. President, thanks for doing this first of all. In your opinion, what should a young adult, 18-25 with a low income aim to accomplish to set a path for a successful future? I look forward to reading your responses to various posts, you will have my vote for 2012 elections.
Thanks for doing this Mr. President.

How do you feel about the increasing age of retirement and social security possibly not being around in the future for recent college graduate like myself?
Thank you so much for your time Mr. President. We really appreciate it! My question is about foreign affairs. I am curious as to how you view the evolution of foreign affairs in the future and what you believe should be America's involvement with other nations.
I love you, President Obama.
How do you cope with all of the insanity being the President brings?

I can't imagine much else that would be a more stressful job, even if yours does have it's perks.
Mr. President,

Do you think that [basic income/social dividends](http://www.naturalfinance.net/2012/06/imperative-need-for-social-dividends.html) (basically a cash stipend given to all adult American citizens) is something that the democratic party will support eventually?

Its the right way to reform welfare and medicare and other senior entitlements.  It will provide a huge economic stimulus that happens to create the demand necessary to spur business investment.  It solves poverty, and also reduces the risk for people to invest in their own education or business startups, and adjusts to a world that is structurally changing to no longer need as much employment as it has in the past while still providing customers for rich people/innovators to sell their products to.

I think you would win reelection for sure, and genuinely improve America and humanity through the example, but perhaps you can just say something nice about basic income for the future?
I'd really like to play some Halo or Call of Duty with you.  What's your xbox live Gamertag? I won't treat you differently because you are the President.  That also means that you'll have to make your own sandwich.
Hello, Mr Obama. Being from the UK, I don't know much about your ideas. What I do know about is healthcare reforms, which I have to say free healthcare is great, it works fine here. What else are you hoping to achieve in your next term?

Also, how did you find the Olympics, since everyone in the UK was surprised at how good they thought it was.

Good luck in the upcoming elections.
America is often seen as a war mongering nation bent on dominating any states that might serves it's wants. 
Do you think there is truth in this statement? 
Furthermore, what would you do change this image/fact?
Everyone seems to be asking political questions. This will get buried, but Mr. President, could you share your most embarrassing moment or a similar anecdote?  I really appreciate the fact that you're doing this and wish you luck in November. You have my vote (though sadly this won't mean much because I live in WV).
Hows life since you became president?
Hey Mr. President, do you ever get lost in The White House? It seems like that would happen easily.
Why should I vote for you?
Hi Mr. President.  When you get reelected (woo!), I'd love to have dinner with you.  I'll even bring some beer.  Feel free to invite me over and I'll be more than glad to make the trip!
How hard is it to stay true to your beliefs and convictions when in such a powerful position as the President of the US? After four years in power, what is your take on the saying "power corrupts"?
Greetings mr. Obama!

First of all, I am a social-democrat of Sweden, and I would like to take the opportunity to praise all the actions and moves you are making, and have made during your presidency. I believe that it will make the better for everyone on the large scale.

I feel that really the only question(s) I can come up with, is,
what do you think about Sweden? Been here? Like the country?

Cheers, and have a wonderful day!
What plans does your administration have to encourage protection of cultural resources?
Mr President, thank you so much for doing this.

My question is pretty straightforward: Do you believe that every argument, whether it be about the economy, LGBT rights, global warming, etc, has two equal sides? If so, why? If not, which ones?

Again, thank you very much.
This isn't related to politics, but I was winderig where yo learned to speak so well. I'm not even Anerican, and I listened to the state of the union speech you made, and I found it hard to stop listening to you. 

Also, congrats on being the first black president. =)
Do you find it difficult to balance your work life and your family life? Do you feel like you get enough time to spend with your kids? I stress about that every day, and I'm not the President of the United States.
How confident do you feel about this election?
What advice can you give a father-to-be?
Take note, I say this as a supporter and as someone who voted for you and plans to vote for you again: 

When you were elected, you swore to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, but frankly, I haven't seen a lot of that from you and your administration. I'm very sympathetic to the difficulties you've had with congress, but even forgiving that you've signed things that have really hurt our freedoms. How do you justify that to the American people? What are we getting in exchange for increased civilian surveillance, detention, and execution without judicial oversight?
Who first inspired you politically or philosphically?
President Obama,

For all the doubts the people here have about your policies and actions, and for all the critical questions you are no doubt being bombarded with at the moment, rest assured that the majority of the people here will support you if you answer their questions with fairness.

I personally want to thank you for going into the White House trying to do the right thing. Even if you haven't fully succeeded yet, you're lightyears ahead of the competition.
What are your thoughts on the polarization of the political process?
Mr. President is there interest within your administration to fully liberate our country from greedy telecommunication companies?  I recently traveled out of our country and saw that within these countries you really had freedom to choose which provider would supply phone/internet/cellular service.  A government mandated division that would oversee our internet infrastructure would help many of us dealing with excessive costs to supply what many European countries already see as a human right.  I know you fight for full broadband adaption in this country, but that won't happen while telecom companies are sucking up spectrum and data lines to overcharge other companies to utilize them.  I think if you were to push government regulation of our infrastructure (i.e. cellular towers, fiber optic lines), we can become a leader in broadband adaption.
Mr. President,

My father, who has worked in the private sector (he was a software developer) for more than 25 years has not had a steady job for close to 3.5 years and has been completely unemployed for the last year. What are you doing to aggressively create jobs in the private sector? We have been told by hiring managers that the legislation passed by your administration is unfriendly to business.

Because my neither my father nor mother can find jobs steady jobs, they have been forced into withdrawing money from their IRA accounts in order to eat and pay rent. The IRS has demanded they pay their taxes on the amount withdrawn. Hilary Clinton said that she would grant amnesty to people in similar situations as my parents, why haven't you? This recession is almost 4 years old.
Can you please free Bradley Manning right now? Over 800 days and he still hasn't had a trail, and I doubt anyone thinks it will be a fair one if it ever comes. 

The man is a hero; he deserves his freedom.
Hello Barack. I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds by calling you by your first name. I see and hear a lot about you through the media and feel as though once in a while you may like to be addressed using your given name. I know I would.

I am not American, nor have I ever spent too much time in the United States, save for a quick time-saving drive through Minnesota while on a trip to Ontario. I won't bore you with details, but even though it was only for a few moments, they were magical ones in which only being a few hundred kilometers over the border meant I was in the self-proclaimed "land of the free". I remember (this was years ago) craning my neck looking around for familiar landmarks, but being northern Minnesota, I was disappointed with fields of some type of grain.

There is a lot of controversy surrounding American politics lately. The state of the country seems to be one of constant calamity and whoever yells the loudest tends to have their voice heard of the others. It is a zoo in which the loudest animal gets his/her way. 

I am not going to pretend to understand the intricacies of your political system or tell you something should be one way or another. Rather, I want you to know that regardless of any pressure you have been under you have always managed to maintain dignified level of decorum, and this, Mr. President, is what gains the respect from not only your Americans, but your audience abroad as well. 

Opponents of yours that refuse to get their facts straight, attempt to be respectful, or outright lie are what is marring the worlds view of America and it's government. Thank you for championing this high level of demeanour and returning an acceptable dignity to the role of leader of the people.

Thank you, 

a fellow cadet on spaceship Earth.
Mr. President, 

How is the NASA Budget coming along?
In your opinion, what can be done to help college students that do not apply for FAFSA, yet still can not afford basic community college courses without going into debt?
Hello, President, I just wanted to know:

Will you strive for everybody to pay their fair share of taxes even more in your second term? Also, do you think you will ever change your position on marijuana?
Do you believe deregulation led us to our current economic state?
First off, welcome to reddit Mr. President!

I'm currently a student in my final year of university, I actually go to school a few blocks away from the white house. 

Anyway, I would like to know how you plan on addressing the issues dealing with student loans that have arisen in the past few months. At the end of June, a congressional measure passed which allowed a freezing of the interest rates for one more year, while simultaneously removing some benefits such as the grace period on the interest after graduation. 

I'd like to know if you have a plan in addressing this because it is a pressing issue to me, and many other students like me who have benefited greatly from the federal loan programs. I believe that this could be a catalytic issue in getting the youth interested in your campaign, and i urge you to address this issue head on. 

**Shameless plug**- I think you should come speak at our graduation in May...haha. 

Thanks for taking the time to do this!
Mr president, sir. 

As a soldier in the United Sates Army, and an American patriot, I have many many questions for you. But one strikes me as most important.

I shall never, fire upon my fellow Americans, and that's why this is so important to me.

What is your rationalization, and purpose, for allow the NDAA to be passed?
Mr. President:

Have there been times that you've just wanted to bust into Congress and just say "Grow the eff up, already?!?!" Because I have.

When they sat around and congratulated themselves for mixing and mingling and sitting among members of the other party during the State of the Union addresses, I wanted to send them all notes saying "Welcome to adulthood! This is how ALL adults live their daily lives - sitting and working with people they may not always agree with or even like. But we all do it. Daily. Without going on the news to talk about how awesome we are for it."

That and all of the NOT DOING THEIR JOBS has got to make you extremely frustrated. It can't be just me or, rather, us, can it? 

Working under those types of conditions has got to be far more frustrating than any job any of us can fathom. 

So, why would you want to another term? What about this job offers the level of rewards and feeling of "I'm doing good stuff here" makes it worthwhile and worth dealing with all of the scrutiny and bs? 

Thank you for your time. 

A.
Sir, thank you for doing this. We are honored to have you here. 


1. After the repeal of the Glass-Steagall act, we've seen the financial situation become increasingly chaotic. Also, from what I've read of the Dodd-Frank act it has A) Not been implemented and B) Doesn't include the separation of security firms and commercial banks. I don't pretend to be a financial expert, but how do you intend to address this problem?   

2. With the McCain-Fiengold bill practically useless due to the Citizen's United ruling, how do you intend to stop this rampant super pac problem?

3. Do you intend to raise the capital gains tax and if so, how? 

4. Can you, and would you be willing to get lobbyist organizations under control? 

5. Do you intend to put pressure on Pakistan to change their blasphemy laws?

6. What other countries/governments have you looked to as the map for policy in this country? 

7. Do you intend to repeal the detainment of American citizens provision in the NDAA? 

8. How will the NSA's Utah data center be utilized?

9. Would you be willing to help change the current presidential debate format to be more challenging? 

10. Would you be willing to instate a law that bars people from influencing policy with money in other countries, when that policy is discriminatory and harmful? I can't think of a better way to word it, but there has to be a way to keep people like Dan Cathy from sponsoring bills that make homosexuality punishable by death in other countries. 

11. Will you support the T.P.P and other internet regulations? (I hope not but would like an honest answer)

Thank you for your time, and I understand if you can't answer all or any of my questions due to reasons of national security or simply by compromising yourself during the election. Please know, while I disagree with you on many things I admire you immensely and will vote for you in the upcoming election. 
Edit: format
With republicans deliberately stalling on anything you try to accomplish in order to make you look bad, how can this be overcome in your second term?
Hi Mr. President. Thank you for taking time for us!

As someone who voted for a republican the last two elections (admittedly) I am proud to say you have my vote after your progress these past four years and positive looks towards the future and upcoming generations. Thanks!  

My questions:

Should you be reelected would you consider a visit again to Vermont?  I'd love to meet you. 

Honestly, how do you feel about the famous thumbs up meme of you that is widely circulated on here? 

(I couldn't think of anything overly intelligent to ask on such short notice!)
Not very important question, but, who convinced you to make an AMA on reddit? I want to throw all my money at him.
If you could bring back one person from throughout history, who and why?
Do you feel that political campaigns have degraded to nothing but mudslinging at the opposition as opposed to candidates actually talking about what they will do for their country? Also, do you believe that the leaders of our country have become more swayed by the public view and that they are no longer leaders, but more so followers of the public?
What obstacles still remain to achieving a United States where women are treated equally, and are able to make their own choices regarding their reproductive system (specifically contraception and abortion)? What measures can and will you realistically take to overcome those obstacles?
What previous position best prepared you to be President?
Why is it that when I try to load the comments in this thread it says down for maintenance, but all of the other ama's work?!?
Mr. President, as an up and coming teacher, what do you plan on doing to try and fix our education system? Education, and young minds, are the biggest resource our country has and the education system, along with results, are on the downswing and I was wondering if you had any plans to try and revive and rebuild our system. Thank you for your time and you are incredible for doing this!
First. THANK YOU for taking the time to actually connect with us. 
Obviously, you're going to win the election. Is there anything else we should know about the MITT?
Mr. President, I know there have been some barriers, but are you planning to label GMOs during your next term as you promised during your '08 campaign?
Hi Mr. President!

If you would have a job that doesn't involve politics whatsoever, what would it be? (and why?)

Good luck with the elections!
Did you make a deal to make Hillary Clinton Secretary of State at the Bilderberg conference in Chantilly, Virginia?
Mr President:

I know that you don't bend over backwards for your donors, and I appreciate that. But I feel like my government is bought. I feel like my senators are bought. I feel like my president has been bought. And if Mitt Romney wins this election, it will have proven to me that the presidency can be purchased.

I have thought about what I would say to you in person, and it would be this: Prove to me that government cannot be bought. 

I'm not convinced.
As a Canadian, an aspiring Harvard student and an Obama supporter (like so many other Canadians), I wish you the very best of luck on your upcoming election. I have no question to ask of you, as I'm sure your vision and wisdom will answer every doubting and concerned voice during your second term. I feel you are the person that can bring America to its real, and sometimes forgotten, potential.

My very best to you, President Obama.
Do you believe we should tax the churches?  Why or why not?
Canadian here, just want to tell you how great of a president I think you are, keep it up. Really hoping for your next term and a democrat senate.
I am a 25 year old small business owner with one employee....how is your economic plan better for me then mitt romneys plan....healthcare too
Mr. Obama,

I think a two party system is a poor representation with the multicultural diversity that the United States has.
The current state of affairs makes it clearly prevelent. You are honestly the lesser of two evils should you be reelected, but I am really not happy with many of the platforms you run on. How can we as a society progress to a different more party friendly society so as that it doesn't seem that we are voting for the choice of a rock and a hard place?

My other question is in regards to the war on drugs. In the past you have openly discussed your drug use and have clearly demonstrated much success in your life. Why do you still feel a need to imprison those who use drugs instead of either decriminalizing or at the very least increase drug counseling? Prisons are being filled at an alarming rate most of which are nonviolent crimes related to drug use (this is pathetic for our progressive culture).

I wish you the best of luck this fall Mr. Obama.
Aliens. Yes or no.
why havent you rescheduled marijuana so it can be safely prescribed to patients nationwide?
Do you believe corporations deserve the same rights as human beings?
Mr. President, How come we have trade and travel between China and the USA but not with Cuba? They are both communist countries
SEND ME TO SPACE. ALSO I WANT A HOVERBOARD. ALSO ALSO JETPACK. PL0X & THX BRO
What sort of flowers do you buy Michelle when you're in the dog house?
Hey POTUS, I notice you use a Magic Mouse. Don't you find it kinda uncomfortable to use?
Mr. President, you've single-handedly crashed Reddit. What do you have to say for yourself?
Mr. President, as a lesbian living in this country, I wanted to thank you for supporting us as it draws near to a very important election for you. I was wondering what your party will do to increase support in helping us get equal rights.  

Edit: grammar.
Mr. President, I recently got married to the love of my life, what's the best marriage advice you could offer?
Mr. President

What are your thoughts on the new voter I.D. laws that have been sweeping the nation?
I just wanted to say thank you for making the Affordable Care Act a priority. I'm a recent college graduate, currently working to save money for grad school, and it's been a rough time for me health-wise since graduation. It would've been an enormous strain to try and get diagnoses/treatment without being kept on my dad's insurance, and now I don't have to worry about being denied in the future for pre-existing conditions either.  It's a huge weight off my shoulders, and I am grateful.
Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the rash of accusations (absurd or otherwise) that are thrown out at you constantly? Do you feel that constant petty bickering is a problem and hinders real progress or that it is necessary to do so for the most knowledge about public figures to be placed out there?
Mr President, 

My question to you is this....

I am a full time student, who works full time downtown Chicago as I put myself through school.   As it currently stands working for minimum wage isn't enough to support myself and go to school at the same time.   My first year of school here in Chicago I remember living off a bag of rice for an entire month.   My electric bill is well over a thousand dollars because I cannot afford my 650$ rent on top of my electric bill.  As it currently stands working at minimum wage full time is not enough to help me stay current with my bills and go to school full time and better myself.   

I don't understand how as an American this is fair.   The men that own the franchise I work for are boasting record numbers, and giving out great bonuses to each other and they are doing so off the backs of hard working people like myself.   Make no mistake about it, working for these wages in an economy like our is torture.   

This is clearly a product of corporate greed that has become so imbedded with our society and government that the people around me 
(min wage co-workers who are not pursuing a higher education) have become accepting of this and don't understand that something is wrong.  Every where I turn I see media owned by corporate business shoving lies down my throat and telling me this life style is ok, and If I'm not rich its because I'm too lazy.  

If you are elected into a second term, I want to know what you are going to do to remove the whispers of big business and those god damn evil banks from our elected officials in Washington, and what you are going to do to see that I can support myself through a higher education without having to starve.

P.S See about shoving a law down congresses throat that makes it federally illegal for a company calling itself "News" to lie to our citizens.
Hello, Mr. President, and thank you for doing this.

First of I'd like to thank you for letting undocumented youngsters who were brought to this country a 2 year reprieve from prosecution.

The question I'd like to ask is, once you are elected for a second term, will you get the DREAM Act passed?

Also, [my dog would like to say hello](http://i.imgur.com/DjlGt.jpg)

Thank you.
Now that the president has discovered reddit... White house productivity all time low.
Mr. President, firstly I want you to know I voted for you. I have great faith in what I believe you can accomplish in a second term. I am a Mexican-American lesbian woman who recently finished a Master's degree with a significant amount of debt. 

What will your administration's position be in furthering gay and lesbian's equal rights, to include health benefits and tax benefits? 

Additionally, what is your administration's platform on Education in America? And, what changes are you willing to make to make the US more competitive in education, from K-12 through high ed?
Dear Mr. President,

Since you were inaugurated, the Republican party has made it its mission to stonewall you at every turn (Draper's book, for example, details a meeting of Republican leaders + Newt Gingrich agreeing to do everything it takes to make sure that nothing passed). They've exhibited an unwillingness in the extreme to compromise and collaborate. Your modus operandi appears to be one of a collaborator and compromisor; which when dealing with rational actors on the other side would be a laudable and great way to act.

At this point though, it's clear that there's nothing to be gained by collaboration - so why persist with that strategy? Wouldn't it be better to take issues to the American people, and highlight the obstructionism, rather than trying to chart a course through it?

TL;DR version: When are you going to stand up and fight for your principles without compromising? They're willing to do that, and have been doing it in spades (almost to the point where it could be described as treasonous).
Thanks for doing this!  
Software providers have thus far managed to pretend they aren't bound by consumer expectation. Many End-user License Agreements have statements to the effect of 'we are not liable even if our software destroys your property and we knew it would happen.' This isn't sustainable as a long-term policy, and instead of the law catching up to protect consumers it is in many cases protecting the companies that create these contracts (AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion has prompted software companies to 'exempt' themselves from class-action suits). Arbitrarily terminable licenses are now common where before possession of something real was the norm (my N64 copy of Goldeneye is still running strong). Do you think law will be able to change with technology or is this problem going to have to come to a head before it will be attempted to be solved?

Mr.President,

How are you so down to earth and bad ass while leading the USA?
Which of the original three Pokemon was your favorite? Charmander, Squirtle, or Bulbasaur?
Hi, Mr. Obama! If you win the election, what are you going to do about the education budget? My school in Pennsylvania let go aroune one hundred and eighty teaching positions and the ratio of student to teacher has risen signifigantly. The children, my generation, are the future of america, and without proper schooling, can lead to a LOT of things going wrong. 

Sincerely, a high school student worried about America.
Hi Mr.President,

I wanted to say that I support you 100% and I helped people vote in 2008 and I will again this year. Here is my question...

America's education system is broken, as a democrat it is out of line for me to be against teachers unions, however I think it's become appalling obvious that something needs to be done to revitalize education, what would you do in your last term to work on this issue. 

And a follow up, how will you confront the more than 20% that suffer from learning disabilities (myself included) I had to go to private schools and then sue the public system to pay for my education, how will this be figured out?
Mr president I've never voted till 2008 when I voted for you. I'm from San Antonio Texas and I'm very pleased with San Antonio mayor Julian Castro involved in the DNC. Do you plan on helping him make Texas a swing or blue state in the near future? Btw you are doing GREAT job!

What kind of toll does your position take on you?
What is your plan for ending the War on Terrorism? 
There seems to be no actual goal for this war and the policy we have right now is kill every terrorist and possible terrorist (including American citizens).
This is a neverending war that requires never ending funds. 
Do you plan on passing this burden to your children? Grandchildren?

I have something of a bone to pick with you. I have lived three blocks from you for the past four years. You have the largest backyard in the neighborhood, yet I haven't once been invited over for a bbq. What's up with that?
What are your feelings about the dramatic increase of mass incarceration of black men for nonviolent drug crimes?  Will you publicly speak out against what many call "The New Jim Crow" ?
Mr President, Would you agree that Mountain Dew is the greatest soda ever made?
Im not against religion entirely, and on top of that i live in Australia, but does the fact the church and state are still very much connected (despite your constitution) bother you? Do you plan to work on the seperation of church and state?
Im not asking for your personal religious views, or whether you plan to destroy religion (that would be ridiculous). This is purely a political question
Many have argued that the war on drugs has essentially become a war on the non-white.  Rather than end this, your administration has arguably doubled down on the drug war.  Do you really think America benefits by imprisoning more people than China and Russia combined?  Do you really believe Americans _deserve_ to be incarcerated at higher rates than people in other countries?  If we stopped imprisoning so many people for victim-less crimes, do you think we might have whole and stable families that could help our country prosper?
What is your opinion of Dr. Ron Paul? It is many a political junkie's dream to see the the two of you square off... Since that will never happen, can you offer your honest opinion of him, and his work/supporters, and his belief system? His supporters need SOMEONE to vote for..
Hi, Mr. President.

Would you support campaign finance reform which included only public funds or at least serious spending limits which penalized 501(c)(4) Nonprofits that make political action their primary goal?

Alternatively, I'm 36 years old. Do you think I will live to see Glass-Steagall reinstated or some similar bill passed?
Hi Barack, I'm from England and was just wondering what your opinion on assisted suicide is? Because recently a man with locked in syndrome had to starve himself to death as he was refused assisted suicide, do you think it's something the goverments should start considering?
Hey Mr president, What's the best piece of advice you've been given and by whom?
To me it seems that the Republican party is becoming ever more extreme, the far left is feeling ever more disenfranchised, and actual discussion of anything is being lost in increasing polarization.  Do you agree with this assessment, and agree or disagree what do you see as the future of American political discourse?
Dang! POTUS broke reddit. Well played Sir....Welllllll played.

President Obama --

1) What is your favorite meme?

2) Tell us your favorite dirty joke.
One thing. Can you post a picture of yourself making the "not bad" obama meme face. Just to put as my wallpaper.
I wonder if Mr. Obama takes an occasional stroll down r/gonewild lane?
I know this might not bear a lot of political relevance, but 

Mr. President- Are you happy in general? I know your job must be extremely stressful, but aside from that, do you enjoy being the representative of the people of The United States? Any response would be extremely appreciated. Thank you.
Mr President, I know there's a high chance you won't read this or be able to answer, but I'm sure it's on the minds of many potential voters. 

Would you consider having a referendum on soft drugs including but not limited to marijuana given that more than half of americans are now in favor of legalization? 

Despite the political capital I can imagine the GOP would try to make out of it, I feel this choice would allow you to win over a great many small government conservatives who are tilting between their old party that is betraying their values and a scary alternative. Thanks.
What is the thing you hate most about being president?
What's your favorite joke that you've heard about yourself?

Mr. President,

No question at all just wanted to thank you on behalf of all of us here. Thank you for doing* this AMA it's an honor to know a busy man as yourself would take the time to actually answer some of our questions. Once again, thank you sir and have a wonderful day!

Mr. President, What is your favorite film?
Mr. President, do you have a favorite food?
An issue that I haven't heard a lot of discussion about from either side is the privatization of the prison industry.  To me, the idea seems very wrong as it gives businesses an incentive to keep people in prison for profits, which come from public funds.  I think this takes away from prison as an idea of a place for rehabilitation and places people's lives in the hands of greedy corporations.

How do you stand on this issue?
Mr. President, 

First of all, thank you for doing an AMA. This level of connection with the people you represent is one reason why I originally voted for you, and why I will do so this coming November. In addition, I'd like to extend my most heartfelt appreciation for openly supporting LGBTQ rights. It's about time someone took a positive stance on it, and I'm very glad that it was you. 

As a future teacher, much of my learning in the last semester has been focused on how to accurately assess the progress made by students in my class. This includes standardized testing as described in the parameters of No Child Left Behind. You have made great strides to lessening the pressure on schools and focusing more on individual student achievement. You recently granted a waiver on NCLB to my state (Wisconsin) and many others that have chosen to implement their own measurements of student achievement. This is a great improvement. 

So my question is: If (hopefully when) reelected, what's next for NCLB? Do you have any plans to improve or even repeal it? Or is the waiver system as far as it is going to go for now?
Mr. President, 

It feels like the left allows the right to manipulate information (translate: lie) with little consequence. This is extremely frustrating to moderates and liberals alike. Why is this allowed? Where is the communication from the White House? I feel like the republicans have a corner on communications with their uniform talking points. They lie so much that reasonable people start to believe them.
What do you think of the electoral college? If you think we should switch away from this method of presidential election, do you have another method you'd favor?
Finally got it.

Mr. President - First of all thank you for taking the time to come to reddit and answer some questions.  I don't know if this has been asked yet, but does your campaign have a planned response for misinformation being used in speeches by the GOP and Romney?  It seems like they mostly just get away with it outside of the internet, but that could be the major news networks not doing their due diligence.
I Love Our President
Imperial or Metric?
I was trying to figure out why reddit was being so slow XD. Welcome to reddit Mr. President. I'm canadian so I must ask, what is your view on canada?
Mr. President, there have been a lot of lies about you and your policies coming from the right. The Romney campaign seems utterly unconcerned with reality. How can you fight these lies and how can we help?
Mr. President, will you scruffle my hair a bit?
Sir, I am a Federal employee working only a few blocks from the 18 Acres.

Would you like to have lunch? Thanks for your consideration.
If you lose the election, can you please move north and run Canada?
Mr. President,
I am a former US Marine and veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2008. I want to express my gratitude for doing what you do, day in day out. I can only imagine how little sleep you must get while serving as the Commander and Chief of the greatest nation in the world. So thank you very much sir.
I would also like to say that it is pleasantly refreshing to see someone who holds a such a high and prestigious position like yourself taking the time out of his/her day to come to community website and events to talk to the people. All the people and all walks of life. Especially here on reddit, which I was (until this day) positive people such as yourself (elite politicians) didn't know existed.
I feel that everyday, more and more Americans are losing faith in their government. More and more there are outcries amongst the population calling for a mass overhaul of government and delegates. While I don't myself agree with these views, I feel that the majority of people have lost pride in calling them selves "American", and I believe this to be a key element to a lot of issues, social and economical, plaguing our country today. My question is do you have any plans to address this particular issue?
Thanks again Mr. President!
Dear president, please win...
I can't think of anything logical to ask you because my brain is jelly right now by your presence.
Wait. I got one. 
I uhm.. heard you can control the weather. Please make it snow hard enough for extra snow days. 

Thank you xoxo
Mr. President, 

I wanted to share with you what is possibly the biggest reason I plan to vote for you in November. I have seen numerous speeches of yours where you address the different religious groups as equals, including American atheists. I identify myself as an atheist, not because of a hate for god, not because of any hate of any kind, but simply because I weighed the claims of all sides and made a decision for myself. I think I speak on behalf of many atheists when I say I do not want, at all, any special treatment, ever. What I do want is the same treatment to be given to all religious groups. Meaning, Jewish and Christian groups should not be given special treatment of any kind as well. We are not "one nation under god" but are instead "out of many, one" as our differences should make us stronger and more flexible. I feel that you have done extremely well at representing ALL groups while navigating the hard fact that all politicians in this country seem to have to be Christians to get elected. If you see this, please share your thoughts on the matter, because I feel atheists in America is a great untapped resource that could greatly aid your polls.
As a college student, tuition is very expensive. What is your stance on this issue and education as a whole for that matter?
Mr. President, when will the US end the failed war on drugs?
Mr. President, I spent 6 hours queueing to see you speak in Dublin last May. It's going to be something that I tell my grandkids about. It was an absolutely incredible day.

That day you mentioned that Ireland and the United States have some of the strongest ties between any two countries. Those ties are economic as well as diplomatic and cultural. Foreign direct investment from companies in the United States has sustained Ireland through the recession and greatly benefited us over the past 20 years. In the United States the message is obviously that American jobs should be protected and created and I believe you are the man to do that but how are you going to encourage job creation in the United States without punishing companies that have good and legitimate reasons for sending some jobs to economies like ours?
In 2008, you promised to repeal the Bush tax cuts and raise taxes on higher income tax groups. You have not done either and in fact extended the Bush tax cuts.

Your response Mr President? I fully backed you 100% back in 2008, but besides these two I've seen a string of broken promises. I had just reached voting age and already my trust in our political system was broken. I guess I was naive.
I didn't vote for Obama, but I can now proudly say I upvoted him.
A question about enemy combatants: I've read that you've reclassified all males in a strike zone as enemy combatants to avoid counting civilian deaths.  This reminds me a whole lot of tactics used by the Bush administration, and my disgust with these kinds of policies are the reason I voted for you in 2008.  Why have you decided to continue with these sorts of policies under your administration?
Mr. President, I am a college student who is facing a daunting student loan once I graduate.

What are your administration's plans to help make a university education more affordable?

Likewise, what are your thoughts on the growing need for a college education to obtain even the most basic entry level positions in the job market?

Lastly, my roommates and I can't decide whether to get a ferret or a chinchilla, which would you prefer?

Thanks

Hi Mr. President,
Pleased to meet you. I am a royal prince from the most excellent country of Nigeria. Recently I have decided to make a large investment into one of your country's great companies. In order to complete this transaction I will need your help. The potential commission and fees for your services could potentially be enormous. I seek your help because as the President, you are the only person who can assist me in this highly important and confidential matter. However in order to make such a large transaction I will need you to open an account for me and deposit a preliminary balance of $500 under my name. Once you do this I will promptly send you the first of many commission checks, starting at $200,000 and sent every other week until November 4, 2012. Please respond immediately so we can work together to make your great country's economy grow. 

Very sincerely yours, 
His Royal Highness Makhefer Wombagt

As of a few weeks ago, I am a father. My son was born through IVF using a donated embryo. As you can imagine, I have concerns about some of the recent escalation of rhetoric around the rights of women, & reproductive rights in particular.

My (two-part) question for you, President Obama: (1) Can you lay out, in no uncertain terms, what your policy stance will be with regard to IVF, reproduction, & women's healthcare & reproductive rights during a hypothetical second term; and (2) will you continue to push the envelope in terms of pressing for improvements in healthcare, or have you done all you plan to do?
What are your plans to wean the United States off oil and coal and onto more environmentally friendly energy sources?
I may never agree with Obama's policies and I may never vote for him, but what a cool fucking dude this guy is!
You saw it here first boys, this is history in the making.


Can you even *imagine* a site like this one being important enough to get and interview like this one before now?


We should be proud.
Dear President Obama,

I consider myself a moderate voter, and while I have not thoroughly enjoyed your presidency so far (not by any bias of my own - some policies I simply didn't agree with, like the bailout), I am looking forward to voting for you for a second term so that you may better implement some of the policies I agree with (gay rights, socialized medicine, etc). 

I do have one question, though, regarding education in the United States that seems to not come up in explicit detail enough in debates - especially among the republican party. The educational system in the United States seems to be in decline - not just on an economic level, but in content and in graduation rates across the country. 50% of Ph.D recipients in the United States are foreign born (in some cases and schools, 100% of them), which, for the number of American college students, is an abysmal ratio.

From the republican party, the only thing we hear regarding education in the U.S. is "an end to tenure and teacher's unions" as a solution to a problem that is only partly addressed by attempting to introduce competition into the teaching occupation, and does little to address the woeful standards of teaching, with no clear economic plan to support this.

That and their support of Creationism and religious freedom in schools has me incredibly worried.

What will be your platform regarding education in the U.S. - both contentious and economic, for your next term?

Cheers, and thanks for being so open about this. You have my vote.
Sir,
What are your thoughts about the crisis in Syria? Any idea if our military will step in anytime soon?
Do you think that the legalization of marijuana could help the economy?
Mr Obama, every President has to make some tough decisions whilst in office.

I commend Michelle for her fight against childhood obesity.  Will the second term hold any new laws, guidelines for genetically modified food, school lunch nutrition, etc?
When you say you want to invest in science, can you give me some examples of what you mean? By revamping education in schools, tax breaks for starting businesses, or even government funded research?
I have no questions, but I would like to take this rare opportunity to thank you for giving us, the Reddit community, a chance to poke at your mind.

You've shown time and time again that you're tech savvy and a forward thinker when it comes to things internet related.  I have every hope that with this, you are setting a trend that will be followed by the future presidents of the United States in the years to come.  

Thank you, President Obama!
Seriously Mr. President.  Do you like cats?
Mr. President,
Both of my parents (and many of my friends) are either doctors or currently in medical school, and all of them have complained about the new laws enacted in Obamacare. Unsurprisingly, most people i talk to  don't have the slightest clue what Obamacare's about. ***In your words***, can you explain to me exactly what is in the law, and how it affects doctors and patients alike? I'd assume, since it is *your* law, that you'd know whats in it even if it seems like no one else does.
Reddit thanks you for your time.
I was here for this.

First of all I want to say thank you Mr. President! Thanks to you and the deferred deportation act my dream of finishing college is closer to becoming true, you have given me hope after all my hope was lost. Now I wanted to ask, if you get re-elected(pretty sure you will) will you push for the dream act or for some kind of amnesty to be passed?
Mr. Obama, will you please make history and pave the way for the future of man kind by letting us know with a simple Yes or No:

Mr. President,
About 2 weeks ago you stopped in Cedar Rapids, IA and ate breakfast at a place called Riley's on 1st Ave. I was one of the nurses that came out to greet you. Turns out most of our clinic happens to be huge supporters of your campaign. If you come through again could you stop by and say hello to my coworkers in the clinic next door? They're very sweet ladies and would love the visit! 

Thanks,

Hello Mr. President!

 know your platform is commited to green energy and aiming to lessen our dependence on fossil fuels. Many people dont think renewable energy would be sufficient to do the job. Are you aware of the big potential of thorium reactors?

[The Telegraph: Obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/7970619/Obama-could-kill-fossil-fuels-overnight-with-a-nuclear-dash-for-thorium.html)

What is your opinion about advanced nuclear energy in America's future energy mix?
According to the NY Times in 2008: The United States has less than 5 percent of the world's population. But it has almost a quarter of the world's prisoners.

Do you have any thoughts on lowering the number of prisoners or making changes to our legal system and prisons?
As far as I know, you have had no real job outside of politics. You never worked for minimum wage, and you never endured the hardships of the common man. Correct me if I am wrong, please, but I believe you came from affluence. How can lower income families really think that you can identify with them? Do you even know what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck? Since my thought is you don't, how can you possibly justify any of your public reform programs and ideals that aid the lower class? You have no idea what it's like or what they need. 

Edit: you were an attorney for a bit; however, that isn't the kind of job I meant. I'm talking being a server at a shitty restaurant to pay for school type jobs.
Mr. Obama, you're one of the greatest Presidents US has ever seen! If only I could vote this November, I'd vote for you! Keep up the good work! I'm sure a lot of people have mixed opinions on your Healthcare bill, but I just think it's totally kickass!
What did you think about Chris Christie's speech last night?
Hello Mr Obama. I'm not a US citizen, I'm from the UK. I'd like to say firstly that you're much cooler than the wanky 'coalition government' D-Cam and Clegg have going on, when you caught the fly it was amazing.

I'd like to ask, do you have any views now, as the president, that when you were younger you'd have never believed you'd have?

And how often do you have a **proper** day off?
As one of your successors, I would just like to thank you for doing a fantastic job and helping my Presidency run so smoothly.
Mr. Obama,
How do you really feel about the GOP's comments about you being the welfare president and how you aren't really a citizen. For me as a dedicated MSNBC viewer, I feel myself so appalled at the clear racist undertones to it and how they show no respect for you as the leader of our country. I guess I am asking do you ever feel like "Wow no matter what I do or accomplish, that at the end of the day it won't matter because all they see is just a black man in their White House?"
Also feel free to PM me if you don't want to be seen answering such a question publically.

Im an avid supporter of gay rights. I know with states (namely NC) who are absolutly against say so because of religion and the bible although it says nothing of the sort in the Constitution. This is a two part question:
1) Do you believe religion should have no place in politics
And
2) If it were to happen, would go out of your way to pass a bill that says all citizens should marry who they want without discrimination
Thank you for your time Mr. President

Ha, I would never had imagined as a kid I would be capable of communicating with the president of the united states in this way. Hell, my comment will likely drown in all the others but this is still kind of amazing. 

Anyway, love from Norway and Denmark, it must be a stressful job yes? 

Edit:

Oh, I got a question, what would you think of a Scandinavian union that saw Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Greenland (and potentially some of the baltic states) that unify them into one of the 10 economically largest states in the world?

Hmm, maybe not relevant to your position. How do you feel about the Danish approach to healthcare (that is, completely free and universal healthcare to all)? Would it be something that you would like to see adopted in the US and do you believe it would be able to work over the pond?

And what do you think about the fact that we not only provide free education but also pays state grants to pay for living costs while studying that is not necessary to pay back? Is it going to far? Would it work in the US? Or do find it to be something that you would like to see in the US also? 

Eh, I guess I am focusing a bit much on Scandinavia. Sorry, it felt like the only thing I could bring to the table.
How do you feel about Mexico? We have sent troops all over in the Afghanistan, and Iraq, for being horrible, threatening people. But what about our neighboring country? I have heard horror story after horror story, and those immigrants are flooding in to escape a horrible life. I do not blame them. In fact, I believe most any person would do the same. Besides that, their gangs and drugs are slowly rolling into our borders. This is having a huge negative on everything that America is supposed to stand for, but it seems that these problems are being swept under the rug, and a general hatred to those unfortunate souls trying to escape a harsh life. And they all want them deported. Why are we not sending in more troops? Why are we not helping these people, who are closer to us than any in the Middle East? Why do they not seem to deserve our protection?
I hope you see this.

Mr. President. I found this thread a bit late and this will probably be unseen, but I don't care, I'm going to say it anyway.

While you and the Democratic Party for the most part support a lot of things that I believe in, there are a few things I don't. But it still a lot more than the alternative. 

Most of what you have done and tried to do over the last 4 years has been phenomenal, considering the opposition the last couple of years. 

But there is one thing I hope to see more of. Union support. I grew up in a union household; I know a lot of the ups and downs of unions. I feel that there should be more support for them, and at the same time more pressure on them simply to prevent union corruption. If there were a way to lower or prevent union corruption and at the same time encourage unions to grow, I feel that it would be a tremendous help to the economy. 

In my opinion, Unions should stand as the middle ground between employee representation and Employer oversight. Probably not the best wording... But union members are using it as a way to evade their own discipline when slacking on the job. There should be a middle ground where they still have representation but at the same time employees shouldn't get free passes unless they actually earn them. 

Other than more talk about unions, I hope you win in November, because I really don't want a bad CEO to corporatize the US.
Mr. President,

You say you are a supporter of military veterans?  Why then when you took office did the yearly cost of living raises stop for retirees and only started back in the election year?  Why does my healthcare become secondary at 65? I gave 20 years of service for what?  To be considered lower than a politician who can exempt themselves from your healthcare plan that is for all americans?

Respectfully,

Alright Mr. Obama, I have several points I'd like to hear you respond to. Of course, being the cynic I am and relying only on action, not words, to determine a person's measure, it really doesn't matter, I'll chock most of what you say up to appeasement and responses pre-written by aides, but let's see if I can't shake it up and make those aides really run around trying to find an appropriate answer:

Why did you sign the Patriot Act after running on a campaign of not signing it? In addition, why is Gitmo still in operation and our troops dedicated to being in the Middle East for another decade despite campaign claims in 2008 to the contrary?

Why are you even considering things like the U.N. resolution for gun registration when it directly affects our Constitution and our Bill of Rights and therefore may bring to question the very sovereignty of our Union?

Would you be willing to admit that, regardless of whether it was 'terroristic' in nature or not, the Brandon Raub arrest was a direct violation of his first amendment right to speak as he wishes, including dissent against the state?

Why were you so insistent that Obamacare was not a tax when it is a tax is the very argument used to legitimize it in the Supreme Court?

According to what Constitutional power delegated to the federal government is Obamacare legitimized, whether it is a tax or not?

If Obamacare is the answer to our healthcare problems, why is it that you and Congress are not required to participate?

Where in the Constitution does it give the POTUS the power to create laws through Executive Orders?

Is it acceptable to kill U.S. citizens in pursuit of those that have allegedly killed, tried to kill or are planning to kill U.S. citizens when using a system of attack as imprecise as a Drone?

If the War on Drugs is meant to stifle the creation, supply, sale and use of drugs, would you say it has failed miserably now that drugs are more easily accessible, created in more abundance and more easily trafficked than ever before?

If prohibition of alcohol was determined illegitimate and impossible to enforce, ultimately, how is prohibition of narcotics any different?

Do you believe it is a good thing for our Union to have a record number of people on federal and state aid such as food stamps, welfare, etc?

The GOP has adopted a platform of auditing the Fed as well as other watered down goals reminiscent of Paul's campaign and the wishes of nearly every dissenting citizen who want a Constitutional union as opposed to a corporate Union, will you be adopting a similar stance or will you allow the Fed to continue to loan us our money at interest with a currency that has no real asset value, an activity the men who wrote the Constitution were vehemently opposed to and was likely one of the greatest financial reasons for our separation from Europe?

If you had reservations about the NDAA 2011, why sign it at all? Why not require that it be presented in a manner that leaves you with no worries instead of approving a bill that gives near unilateral control to you and your successors?

Why did you tell INS to ignore policy and law regarding immigration? 

Do you believe that U.S. citizens and the States have the right to declare Sovereignty as per the Constitution meaning that they are their own rulers living within a union?

Is this Union a Republic or a Democracy, in your opinion, and which should it be if not what you believe it is?

Do you believe that a fire from jet fuel was actually capable of bringing down 2 class A structures at free fall speed and that the fires were able to spread all the way to WTC 7 and cause enough damage to have it fall or to justify 'pulling it?'

Is it true that you accepted a position in one of the global governments such as NATO or the U.N.? Are you aware that if you did, in fact, accept a position, you are in direct violation of the Constitution and that it may be considered treason? 

Do you believe that it is the people's right to be prepared for revolution and their duty to revolt when the state becomes tyrannical or oppressive, even if it means we revolt while you are POTUS?

Do you realize that the Constitution is the ultimate law of the land and that all laws that contradict or circumvent it are invalid and not to be obeyed? That those that create or enforce any such laws may and should be seen as enemies of the union, even if they are protectors of the state? That the statutory jurisdiction used to legitimize criminalization of victim-less crimes such as drug use, traffic laws and others is actually a cover for UCC law and has no real authority in the States?

If you and Romney are so different, why do you think Goldman-Sachs has contributed vast amounts of money to both of your 'war-chests?'

Thanks for your time, I hope I didn't take you away from anything important.
No question - just wanted to say you really missed an opportunity to use - Barack Ob-AMA.
Oh. My. Goodness. I remember seeing you speak in Notre Dame commencement and I can't believe you're doing an AMA!

How you reach out to us on reddit and the Notre Dame Class of 2009 truly underscores how you are a true candidate of the PEOPLE-- no matter their views and creed. And I just want to tell you to keep up the good work and the awesome and touching speeches and (though I can't vote yet) I would love to pledge my support!
Mr. President,

I hope maybe you'll log back in to just look over some of the comments/questions people have left even if you don't respond. 

I just wanted to say that you have my support.  Don't let the idiots beat you down.  Do what's right for the People.
Mr. President, let's talk about legalization of marijuana. What's your viewpoint on it?
Posting to be apart of history. Thanks for being a leader in women's rights. You have my vote.
Why did you authorize the assassination of American citizens without a trial, you fucking scumbag?
I am going to vote for you.
Mr president, what are your plans to do with all this karma?
After being "bought off" by Monsanto and appointing various Monsanto executives to positions in your staff, how can you let your wife tout her horn about eating healthy organic food grown from a garden in front of the White House?
Posting in epic thread
How do you feel about Osmosis Jones?
This is amazing, great AMA, Good Luck in the elections.
Canadian posting to be part of history !  , Always amazed at what i see on reddit
This is history.  I applaud you for having the guts to post on reddit, and the smarts to reach directly out to this demographic.
Mr. President please ignore my username... but how do you see yourself  10 year in the future?
What do you think was the biggest change between your expectations and the reality?
Please do this again sometime Mr. President. Your initiative here today in internetspace was unexpected and surely inspires the younger crowd to vote.
Thanks for doing this Mr. President! It means a lot to a lot of people.
Do you support trans rights?
Do you have any presidential secrets to tell us?
... Here I was feeling so proud of myself for going to work, school, and getting an awesome jog in. First time logging into Reddit today and I missed something amazing... Til next time President Obama?
Am I the only one reading all the presidents responses in my head using his voice?
Unemployment was supposed to be 6 percent by now according to you Mr.President. It has averaged 8.2 percent this year. Foodstamp use has skyrocketed under your tenure, promises made prior to your election have gone unaccomplished. I am interested in your explanation of these things.
Mr President, do you not understand that there is no such thing as a half-an-hour session on reddit?
Where is helpful_table_maker when you need him/her?
Mr. President, why is marijuana still illegal?
What kind of shampoo do you use?
I think you're really cool. I'm only 15 so I don't really have anything political to ask, but uh.. how'd you get so good at singing? That video of you singing was pretty good! I listened to it about 500 times, haha.
So let me start by saying the president is a total badass and I don't want to detract from him in any way; but does anyone else wonder if he had staffers write questions from throwaway accounts that he had written answers to beforehand?
This time of year, everybody focuses on what you two disagree on. But what issues (if any) do you agree with Romney on? Are there any things  in particular about him that you admire or respect?
I know this is already over, so nobody will see my comment... But Mr. President, I will always remember where I was when I heard the news that you were elected to the office of President of the United States of America. I remember as clearly that it was at a different address, in a different county, from where I live now. So from here on forward, I will always remember the day that President Barack Obama himself reminded me to file my change of address form for voter registration. THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT! I have no question - but good luck, and thanks for doing this!
$20 says when Fox finds out about this, they talk about how he is subscribed to r/atheism.
Mr. President, what is your plan to end the War on Terror and return our country to a state of normality regarding our civil liberties? (i.e. bring troops home, repeal the PATRIOT Act, scale back the TSA, return military spending to a pre-war baseline...)
Fellow Redditor from Germany here. (Still awake at 1.30 am at night :-) )

1. What do you think about the Euro Crisis? How do you think we europeens might solve it?

2. It is possible for you to give your personal direct answers here on reddit? How many people are standing behind you right now to watch that you don't make a major mistake?

3. Can America (the USA) become again an example for the world in terms of freedom, human rights and forgiveness as it was for Germany after WW2?

Thank you and good night form Germany.
If this country is so free then why don't we have a free healthcare system like Canada or France? Why does it cost us so much to keep ourselves alive and healthy?
I challenge you to a game of Basketball, winner gets to be President for a day on 12/22/2012
Millions of jobs have gone overseas, mainly because companies feel it's cheaper to outsource and have the products shipped in, rather than have it made in America, high standard of living and all. 
Would you favor some sort of incentive for companies that employ american workers to help level the playing field?  Possibly an outsourcing tax.
What's your favorite anime? :D
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
Also, I love you!! ...in a platonic, "that guy is so awesome" kind of way.
The night you announced Bin Laden had been killed, were you whistling the Omar song from The Wire in your head as you walked down the hall to the podium?
I don't have a question and this AMA has been over for a bit but in case you come back to browse additional comments on unofficial time -

Thank you for everything you have done. You took the helm of a ship in very rough shape and are undoubtedly not thanked enough for the good things you've managed to accomplish in a short time instead of those you have not been able to due to process, politics, etc. 

It takes a special person to accept the position you have. I wish you well in the future and hope you win another round at the wheel.

Cheers!
Hi Mr. President

What can you tell us about Area 51 ?
What are the chances of me getting a pardon?
Was Armstrong killed because he was going to reveal the conspiracy behind the moon landing?
Do you think the Bears have what it takes to win the Superbowl?
Do you like meerkats?
Hi, I know you have to manage a lot. I voted for you. I think your doing a great job striving for progress and trying to get us back in the forefront of first world nations. I was wondering if there are plans to bring back old banking regulation so that no bank is large enough to threaten the economy?
What is in area 51 you can tell me it will be our little secret....
Hello President Obama, it'd be an honor if you could answer this question. My dream is to go to Towson university. You may know about it. It's about an hour and a half away from your home. The white house. I live maybe 20-25 minutes away from you. So I do fairly well in school. In Montgomery county. But the problem is, college is so expensive. Yes, everyone says, work hard and you'll get a scholarship. But that doesn't change the fact that colleges just don't have the money to give out. So I'm asking you what can you do about this?
Also, I play trumpet. Starting to grow into a fairly good player. But arts programs all around the country are dropping their music program. The adults may not think this as much. But to us kids, we feel like we are being deprived of being creative and expressing ourselves in the way of music. Music is beautiful. It is a language that every singe person in this world can understand. So what can you do to make sure that these programs come back or stay?
Being that you want to tax the very rich and spread the wealth around, why is it that you bail out the banks instead of the little people who lost their jobs and were losing their homes? The banks got the bailout money from you and then repossessed the little peoples homes, a double whammy! Whose wealth are you spreading?
Mr. President, in 2007 I, and about 70 other high school Juniors from across the country had the privileged to be a part of the US Congressional Page Program. While we understood that the services of Pages as government employees was no longer that necessary for the day  to day operations of Congress, thanks to advances in communications technology, I must point out that the Page Program gave us an insight to how our government actually works, and gave many of us the skills to take charge of our futures. I am currently studying to be an Aerospace Engineer and plan to start my own company someday; while many of my fellow pages are on their way to be the future leaders of this country.

Mr. President, would you consider supporting the reinstatement of the Page Program, if for no other reason than to give America's youth the same opportunities that my friends and I were given?
This AMA is over guys, he's headed to dinner.. try reading the top of the page for once.
TIL Barack Obama knows that it takes pics.  Or it didn't happen.
It may be too late, but if for some reason you decide to continue to answer questions, how do you plan on ending super-PACS? I'd love to see an end to them and ensure a more fair election. Thank you for your AMA!
this is not a question i just wanted to post in the same AMA as the president
If you could have done one thing in your first term differently, what would it be?
This isnt a question, its just a comment, even though i cant vote yet, i would vote for you. I know times have been tough and people are pointing fingers, but you have managed to  keep our country together through it all. I forever respect you for doing that sir. Keep doing your job and making the US a better place
I waited so long for the comment window to open due to much traffic, just so I was in this thread. [Now I am.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6tc5duA371qksqoh.gif)
Mr. President. Do you prefer Sativas or Indicas with your home brew?
Why did you create hurricane Isaac?
Wait! Mr.Obama what is your take on marijuana ?
When will Alien Disclosure happen? This is a serious question. I know you're an evolved soul, President Obama.
Why did you try to close wikileaks?

Why did you extend the PATRIOT act?
As a lady from England I shall not ask any questions on your work. Just wanted to say hello!!! 
You're just fantastic sir! Xx
[deleted]
What do you think of Kanye West?
Did he really only answer 10 questions???
It's things like this that give me hope in a democracy.  Thank you, Mr. President!
I don't have a question, I just wanted to say thank you for everything you have done and will do for this country. I don't care what people say about you, I think you are an outstanding president and am just so glad that I have the privilege to say you are my president. I hope that one day I will be lucky enough to meet you. 
God bless you Mr.President
It's been a very rough time for all of us the last few years, It was really nice to get on this site and see the president talking to people and being open to questions. I really think he is doing the best he can do with the hand that was dealt to him in 2008. He has my vote in 2012. This site is cool and I'm an old lady.
Mr. President (AKA Mr. Awesomesauce), would you mind greatly if I sent you [this shirt?](http://shopgoodie.com/barack-to-the-future/)
Your foreign policy is terrible: you caved in to Netanyahu way too easily; you supported Mubarak's regime almost up until the end; your extrajudicial drone strikes eclipse those of Bush in terms of frequency and civilian death tolls (some of your targets are AMERICAN CITIZENS); you did NOT shut down Guantanamo; you still have secret prisons open throughout Afghanistan; etc etc etc etc etc.

You are a corporate, very Wall Street-friendly president who--after all your pro- populist -little man posturing--has not pinned down criminal charges against A SIGNLE ONE culpable Wall Street financial executive.

YOU RENEWED THE PATRIOT ACT! 

You continue to gut financing for NASA to the point that it's less than 0.5% of the entire fiscal budget.  And you have the gall to chat with JPL after the Curiosity touchdown.

These are just a few reasons why Redditors should not vote for Obama.  Obviously, for the sake of all that is holy don't vote for Romney, but Obama is no more deserving of our votes.  Not anymore.
Mr. Obama,

Just tell the truth. Be who you are. Fight for us. Snce this is an ama I will ask you a simple question. Can you be that man? 

The man that will put special interest aside. The man that can be our leader. The man that can decide on right vs wrong? I do not believe that Romney is that man. So you better fucking be him or we are straight up fucked. 

Don't be a stranger.
Hello Mr. President, don't know if you'll get to this, but I'd love to ask you a question relevant to myself. Do you have any plans to possibly provide financial aid or somehow reduce college prices? If so, what are they? I'm a senior in high school and will start the application process soon. Unfortunately I won't be 18 before November so I can't vote, but if I could you would have my vote! Best of luck in the election and thank you for talking to the people.
Why are there more troops in Afghanistan under your presidency than at the end of the Bush presidency?
Mr. President, can you do the dougie?
Mr president, I'm a recent college graduate and just started my first business. I have hired my first two employees and I'm trying to grow my business. Taxes is by far the biggest thing that makes me cringe in doing business. 

I pay my quarterly sales taxes, sales taxes in buying my inventory, FICA taxes for employees wages as well as my personal income taxes even thought my business has not even begun to turn a profit.

What can your administration do to make it easier for small businesses like me to stay competitive with larger companies without taxing us out of business?
I missed it? Damn Chemistry homework tying me up again! I had some really good questions too.
President Obama is such a karma-whore.
Posting. Just want to be a part of history. I will certainly vote this year.
I just want to say thank you for doing this, President Obama! I don't believe any president has ever been this accessible to so many people at one time. I know you're no longer doing this AMA because I couldn't log on thanks to Reddit being overcapacity, but again, thank you!
Mr. President, all I have to say is that reading the answers you have responded to my fellow redditors questions has made me more aware at how great your voice is. I read all of them out loud in your Baracky voice. Your voice is REALLY unique.
I'm still so amazed that the **President of the United States of America** made an AMA.
Lol, barack obama uses mac. Lol.
Rampart for the win. :D
His Karma level is over 9000!  ...almost.
How can anyone possibly downvote this thread? This is one of the best AMA's in the history of reddit. An unprecedented one at that.
Thoughts on Occupy?
Hi Mr President, if you could establish or change one law without needing permission from Congress, what would that be?
Oh man, I missed this while doing homework...darn my college schedule!  With that I am pretty damn impressed President Obama did this. Thank You Very Much. Your believable/sincere outreach to the average people of this country is one of the reasons I voted for you last time. I find your opponent to be a creepy smiling glad-hander. Will Vote for you again 8/10.
HI MR. PRESIDENT!!!!!! :D
Why did you sign the NDAA?
So, personally, which do you prefer Android, iPhone or Blackberry?
How do you feel about cake?
What are you going to do, or try to help to do, about the rising tuition rates for colleges and universities? Tuition is at an obscene level and most people can't pay for it outright and end up going years into debt to pay the colleges/universities back, many times hundreds of thousands of dollars. We're sending our future workforce out already swimming in debt. This is not very good for us who are try to get an education in order to get a higher pay, just so we can pay back our college years for the first years, maybe even a decade+ into the real world. Can you please help to find a way to lower tuition? Especially for out of state students, such as me. We can't take such economic hits so early into our working lives.
Mr. Obama, I know I am late but please legalize marijuana. If it does not work, you have my permission to re illegalize it.
How did this thread go from over 10,000 up votes to much less in a few minutes?
Holy shit. Can't believe I missed this.
Thanks for being in touch, man.
This question is likely to be buried amongst thousands of others, but what the hell?  Not every day you get to ask the President of the United States a question.

Mr. President, I remember hearing about your proposed incentive plan to hire and/or increase pay for math and science teachers around the country.  Has this plan gone into effect and could you further elaborate on your views in regards to math and science education in this country?
I hope in the future you say more to help strengthen and unite the african american people, by speaking out rather than silence. I pray even harder that you release our minorities from the bondage that is the united states prison system.
You probably won't get to this, but what is your opinion of FairTax?
What's keeping you from accepting and passing the Armenian Genocide bill as promised?
Your move, Romney.
Incredible. The President of the United States does an AMA on Reddit and I miss it :(
Hi boss. Welcome.

I am 50, and recently relocated my family to Canada. While planning I was made aware that the United States taxes it's expats on any income over $94,000. My income will exceed that a bit.

Note that I did not flee the country, although I was asked "leaving before that Obama gets elected again, huh? on the same day I was asked "oh, getting out before Romney gets elected huh?" Funny. Anyway, I left because I married a Canadian who got a job offer that will take her career places she could never go in the states.

Now, unless I am mistaken, the last time someone did this - taxed people outside their own nation of origin - a group of drunken goofballs in Boston threw several cases of tea into the harbor upon which his majesty King George's tax had not been paid. 

So: why? It's so complicated and could be costly enough to require I renounce - an increasingly popular option.
What would your ideal education reform plan be, if you didn't have to worry about funding or political opposition?
Mr. President, if you get elected for the next term, will you become more forceful in your politics since you are not looking for re-election? I.E less compromising with the Republicans in Congress and the House?
Mister President I have a question; what is your reasoning behind signing on Reddit and making this thread? Is it to gain votes? Or is there another reason?
For the Americans who don't vote, how would you tell them why they should and the importance of voting?

And if you owned a basketball team, who would be your big 3?
People are downvoting the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Crazy.
Why should I vote for you?
What are your feelings about the entire Mega-Upload thing?

Also big fan, please beat Romney. You'll be receiving my vote.
So he came on Reddit (which is def cool) and answered like 4 questions in the vaguest of manners possible.  He's not promising anything signficant for the next term...that's his confirmed strategy for this election.   would've been nice if he would've been willing to answer some of the tough questions.  like why did he waive the requirement for federal contractors to send out pink slips 60 days in advance as the election approaches?  was it damage control to save votes?  especially since so many of those jobs are being cut in connection w/military spending cuts totaling around $500 billion (which i agree w/in general terms)?

and why has he slept on Syria?  France is playing the role that America should be playing, announcing that they will recognize the rebel forces if they should come into power.

and why is he trading votes w/union demands further bankrupting the country?  we're talking huge dollar amounts that rival the big PAC spending that Obama loves to attack.  Not that he didn't totally give up on Healthcare for All in favor of Insurance For All as part of a backroom deal with the main Insurance Lobby.

And I want to know about his distant past associating w/known radicals. He got a pass on Jeremiah Wright...fine.  But what about some of the other characters, including self-proclaimed anti-zionists?

And why is he pushing for arbitrary mileage improvements on american-made cars causing the industry to lose billions by not focusing on its core competencies of building SUVs and light trucks?  there's already a market force in place for this - the price of gasoline.

Why did your administration compromise on its sale of F 16s to Taiwan?

Was a surge in Afghanistan necessary given that special forces and drones have most useful in taking out Bin Laden and other terrorists?  

and MOST IMPORTANTLY - why didn't you do something about the deficit?????  that was a problem for the ages and you simply ignored it.  In my eyes, that is unforgiveable.
Dear Sirs,  In light of the fact that we ar alledgly helping Veterans why do I have to fight for more than 2 years to get Social Security Unemplyability when I suffer form PTSD as a result fo my Vietnam Service.  Every turn of the way they block me giving me new rules etc when I am claerly disabled and it is clearly as a result of Vietnam.  Thank you. Michael Glatz mglatz@gmail.com
Anyone else have his voice in your head while reading all his replies.
What are you willing to do to help the environment? Many companies(mainly large food companies or ones that deal with chemicals) are destory and endangering the environment. I don't want to suffer the conquences of the actions of the few rich guys. Nor do the rest of young America. What are you willing to do to make sure these companies don't take "loopholes" or use bribery to maximize thier profit and harm the environment?
I purpose that we swap everybody's pay scale for a day...  
Execs & CEOs get minimum wage, while those currently getting minimum wage get paid like Execs & CEOs.

What do you think the potential impact would be...?  
Good, Bad?
Mr. President I'm a bit surprised to finally see you here I never would've imagined you would've wanted to do this, but thank you for doing it.

1) One issue that has become very important that has become very important to me in the last few years is the second amendment. Often I hear you painted as the anti-second amendment president, but seeing as you're doing this I figured why not get a chance to get it from you directly to set the record straight. As someone lives in the metro Detroit area and works in Detroit I'm sure you've heard all the stories of the out-of-control crime rate in the city from the media (which is often much worse than it seems on the news) and many people who often come to Detroit or live here are purchasing guns in larger numbers as of recently (myself included) to protect themselves no thanks to an understaffed, underfunded, and underpaid police force. In your second term do you plan to make any changes to the second amendment as many in gun rights groups fear? As someone who has come to greatly value the second amendment given my current situation talk of this from multiple gun rights groups leave me greatly concerned. 

2) For all the talk I hear from both you and Romeny about jobs on the campaign trail here's the million dollar question I almost never hear asked nor answered: what kind of jobs are we talking about creating here? If we're talking about the large amount of retail/service jobs that have been dominating job growth the past few years (could be wrong here feel free to correct me) and also more often than not completely underpay their employees which continues to contribute to the issue of poverty and the growing wealth gap that is plaguing the country. [This article I read on the Huffington Post this morning spells out the problem better than I can.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-froomkin/jobs-plan-obama-romney_b_1835966.html)
Mr. President: Thank you for taking the time to converse with citizens at a level of connectedness never before possible. What plans do you have for ensuring that the amount American taxpayers share in risks and costs is roughly equal to the amount they share in benefits and surpluses? 
What would you say would be a prudent balance between shared cost and shared benefit?
Question: The United States origins are as a country who made history by leading the world in democratic process.

Now that other countries are starting to institute direct democratic initiatives (letting voters have a final say in what laws are passed or not) can we expect the United States to pick up the torch and push forward with our proud tradition of democracy?
Hello President Obama,

I am excited to see you here on Reddit! I asked my mother if she had any questions for you, and I have her's here.

She has been on Social Security Disability for a number of years. She was a very successful RN who went back to school to get a higher degree, and permanently injured her neck lifting a 300lb patient in Med School and had to claim disability. She's 54 and I'm 25. I help her with a lot of things around the house, but she can barely afford to feed herself and she's lost too much weight because of it, she's very underweight.

She wants to know when the next Cost of Living increase is going to be, if at all? I am very concerned for her financial and physical welfare, and if you could answer this question I will very happily convey your message to her!

Great job on the Reddit IamA! A lot of us know how to ask some pretty tough questions! I thought I'd leave mine brief and personal, but this issue does effect millions of Americans.

Thank you!
You should come visit Moody Air Force Base and support us Airman here! It will definitely boost our morale here!
Dear Barack, 

I am excited to vote for you this November (it will be my first time voting in my life).  Also- you're a person I truly look up to. Not only are you a professional, but you are actually a good person with a good heart.
Best of Luck
Do you think you would make another state visit to Ireland?

Perhaps stay the night?

Your visit, last year, went down *very* well.
Thank You, Sir.
Why does there seem to be a disproportional amount of down votes in here?
[this has got to be a record](http://i.imgur.com/B6jFr.png)!
Good evening Mr. President, sir. Wow this is such an honor... I would just like to know, if and hopefully when you are re-elected as President in the November election, what are some of the things you plan to do this next term, concerning the Middle East, NASA, etc.? Thank you so much for your time, sir! 

P.S. Just a fun little question, what are some of your favorite subreddits so far?
I'd like to see an Obama vs. Romney Reddit thread debate. Is it possible?
Did he ever answer the question about liking cats?
This comment will never be seen by anyone, ever.
He's gone fellas, came in for 30 minutes 3 hours a go and left.  Potus is home, done with dinner and either wrapping shit up down at the office or putting the girls to bed by now. Give the reddit servers a rest gentleman.
Many questions asked....very few answered.
Mr. President, my biggest question is what can be done about the gargantuan divide between Republicans and Democrats? I understand money has made a profound impact on American politics in the past few years but I, as well as all Americans, want both parties to stop arguing over their petty differences and stop filling their individual collection plates and start working together to bring back the interest of America to the forefront. Plus, I'm starting to think that term limits for the House and the Senate is beginning to sound like a great idea.
How much can you squat?
I grew up with conservative parents, and we always butt heads in politics.  I just want to take the time to say thank you for all that you have done, all that you will accomplish as president, and what you stand for. With that being said, who is the person who inspires you the most?
What's your favorite book?
What's your favorite movie?
What's your favorite olympic event?
If you can go anywhere in the world, where will you go, and what will you do there?
Michael Jackson always wanted to shop like a normal human being, is there something you've always wanted to do but couldn't because of your status?
Did you always want to be a president when you were younger? If not, what did you want to be?
What's your favorite thing to watch on TV?
Here in Massachusetts, you have a heavy influence on us, what state had the heaviest support for you?
Who is your favorite band/singer?
What is your hobby? As in collect books, or paint.

Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions. You have my vote if I was old enough to vote.
"By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!"
Me: "He knows!"
Holy shit. This is cool!
I think it's pretty cool that president Obama took time out of his busy schedule to take part in this - he must like cats ;)
good to see our president is spending his time wisely...
in your face, 9gag.
How is it that this thread's karma total is going *down* as the number of upvotes goes *up*? Unless 80% of latecomers are downvoting, I think Reddit's adjustment algorithm is a little hyperactive.
I'm commenting on history!
LEGALIZE!!!?
I know I'm late, but is anyone looking into any high speed rail or mag lev to run cross country? This would get the country back to work, strengthen our infrastructure and pull us out of this recession. Any thoughts?
Mr. President, I was a strong supporter of you throughout most of your first term, and was certain you would get my vote in 2012, but I have been having issues in my decision ever since you signed into law the indefinite detention bill. What will you do during your second term to deflate the police state? How do you feel about the Patriot Act?
legalization of marijuana, mr president. we have all heard about your choom gang or whatever you called it. why has it not been legalized?
Who downvotes this?!
Oh wow great, the President come online to talk to the people, he should of done this when he won, not to campaign. 

I got a new campaign slogan for you, Change you can believe in. I know its the old one but I still want Change.
Mr. President, will you re-consider the federal legalization of marijuana for consumer use; much like tobacco and alcohol?

I don't pretend to assume you will have an opportunity to read/respond to this, but if you do, thank you in advance.
During your campaigning for president in 2008 you seemed so optimistic and hopeful for change in America. I think the affordable health care act is a great step but do you ever feel that american cynicism has hindered your efforts? I loved your optimism when you ran for president but do you think your aim was too high? I just feel you've lost that hope and i don't blame you this country is too big for one man to change. Basically my question is do you have the energy for another 4 years?
OP delivered.
Whats better COD or Battlefield
I know this comment will never be seen, but I would love to know how many advisors and aides helped in answering these questions. Did the President himself type answers to any of these at all? How long was this AMA session planned prior to announcing it. How many positions were thought out in advance with potential questions and answers?
9000 Karma? Leave some for the rest of us man..
Not gonna lie--that verification photo wouldn't fly for anyone else :/
Would you ever pass a law that would legalize marijuana?
Mr. President, can you please come and fix our state?  We've been taken over by a right -wing idiot!!

-Sincerely, 50% of Wisconsin people who actual vote
commenting to say I support Obama, and this is a brilliant way to reach out to young voters. excellent campaigning skills, obama & staff.
I additionally would like to say your wife is doing wonderful things with her    influence as first lady.
How frustrating is it when you hear your opponents (or anyone in general) blame things on you that are entirely out of your control? Like if Congress shoots something down, and then any resulting negative side effects were then blamed on you. Is it hard?
Just wanted to comment because, well, the President was here!
Mr. President,
First off, I'd like to say that its an honor just to ask you this.
My company has put me up in a hotel room in Washington DC for the following month. I've never been here before, and I was wondering if you know of any really awesome hole-in-the-wall restaurants downtown? There's like 5,000,000 places and I don't know who to believe is really "the best in DC". 
Please help, I know you have the real scoop. ;)
Dear Mr. President, on many accountants I have witnessed friends, friend of a friends, friend's brothers, and family become victims of police brutality. My good friend Alexander's brother, Steven, was smoking marijuana in his car on night when he was pulled over. Now, I know that it's illegal and everything, but what happens next is horrible. He was handcuffed and after that, he was maced, tazed and beaten with police baton's. He showed us were he was tazed, he showed us the bruises, and his eyes were incredibly red and sore. And on top of all that, he was 17, so technically still a minor. If you are elected President, please for the love of God, do something about the Nazis that we call Police. All I see them do is injure innocent civilians.
Thanks for coming. :)
Man, the downvotes have really started flowing in all of a sudden.
Mr. President, thank you for breaking Reddit. The only one who deserves a pardon from this would be you! Thank you, a million times, for giving me yet another reason to respect you. I think you're doing everything you can to right the wrongs of our society, and you have my vote. Mad respect to the Commander in Chief.
Mr. President - and I take honor in calling you that - What can we do, as individuals, to help fix the economy?
My god. President Obama in IAmA?
You won't have time to read this (and I'd be very unimpressed if you did), but good luck from your Australian fans. "In this country, we don't vote to keep the best party in - cos there's no such thing - but we vote to keep the worst party out." While no one's perfect, the world needs you and your party to keep the far right fringe party called the GOP from sinking the world into a deep selfish, money-driven conservatism. I can't imagine the pain it'll cause for the everyman.

Woah I can't believe your on reddit IAMA!

Welcome!

Have you browsed any other subreddits(reddit categories) yet?

Example: /r/gaming and this is /r/IAMA

Thanks for the opportunity!
Wow, the President is doing an AMA. This is easily equivalent to Clinton on Mtv. Have to give credit, President Obama is a young vote machine.
Hey Barack,   I am Toy Inventor.   I was just curious what were your favorite toys while growing up?    Good luck in the election.
Did you forget about your promise to close Guantanamo prison?

Did you forget about your promise to end the wars?

Did you forget about scaling back the Patriot Act/TSA?

These were all campaign promises you made in 2008 and you could've realized unilaterally as POTUS and Commander in Chief.  [This campaign graphic](http://witold.org/reelect_obama.jpg) is pretty accurate.

Why are you even doing an AMA if you're going to dodge all the interesting and hard questions?
Holy crap well that is one AMA I did not expect.
Well, this confirms my vote. Well played Mr. President!
Why are teachers in Texas not allowed to get their social security as well as their teacher retirement? The only state employees not allowed to double dip, yet the governor gets his state retirement check AND his governors pay.
116,436 Republicans have now down voted this AMA...

Mr. President, you can be a funny man.
Mr. President, how exactly do you feel about walruses?
Mr. President, once you are finished your second term (let's be honest), could you please come up here to Canada and become our prime minister?
Obama, I think you are great and will be voting for you. There are a few things that I think would be great. I think that Monsanto should be shut down and we should create jobs by going back to smaller farms and natural products. There should also be government jobs for people in welfare that will be easy to do and make people and government money. There are also too many tax breaks for oversea companies and huge corporations. Apple doesn't need $110 billion cash, or to pay 9% in taxes. I look forward to seeing you again in office, and believe that you can create a stronger middle  with higher wages. My only question out of this long list is will you please come to Vermont. It would be incredible to see you in the only state I know as home.
Well hello there Mr. Obama, it is a pleasure to be near you even through the internet!
When will you legalize weed, it's harmless and the country would profit alot from it
So about GITMO.....
A lot less uhhh's in his typing than I expected.
After the most recent economic collapse brought on by the banksters, why is it that none of them went to jail?
Thank you.
Hey, you were in my town yesterday! Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it to the speech, but maybe next time.
I feel the flair Obama!
Thanks for your time, Mr. President. I have a small question that affects my region and industry, but is not brought up often in presidential campaigns

What is your long term plan for the US Forest Service and the future of forestry in the United States?
So how do you plan to get America out of it's huge debt Mr. President?
Everyone could use a little feedback now and then: all-in-all, things aren't so bad. Keep working hard for us!
I am a Ph.D student in the life sciences and a disturbing trend as of late is the mass exodus of foreign students here on H1B visas back to their home countries after graduation. What do you intend to do to encourage highly educated foreigners into staying here in America as they did in the past?
to many comments, no chance you reach this one :(
The one thing that surprises me is that despite the huge number of upvotes, there is nearly the same huge number of downvotes, and this only just manages to come out on top. Considering what kind of a community I think reddit is, this is a bit surprising.
If Nicholas Cage came to you asking for a hidden document from America's history possible something that would qualify as a treasure would you help in his quest ?
Do you use a Mac or Windows computer?

where are the answers??
If you get re-elected, how are you going to treat the mid-east differently? No offense intended mister president, but, your foreign policies regarding the middle east weren't very effective
How do you feel being president has affected your family? Are your children treated differently at school/with their peers?
My question: What the hell have you actually done for the last three and a half years...borrow more money from China?
I cannot wait to make 249,999$ annually.
I was going to ask if he knew that the fact that Portuguese Water Dogs don't shed has nothing to do with allergies-- in fact most allergies depend more on the individual animal rather than the breed and are usually caused more by skin oils and saliva than fur. So maybe he should have adopted a shelter dog after all...
I respect the Democrat and Republican parties, but do you plan to help open the playing field for third party candidates specifically within congress? Particularly changing our current "first past the post" voting system. For those not sure what I am getting at please watch the following videos.

Why are people still asking questions to the guy? He will not see it
Well...in order to go down in reddit history I need to comment. Barack, can we look forward to having our democracy, justice, freedom, privacy and economy back if you are re-elected. I am tired of living this corrupted Orwellian American nightmare. Thanks.
I'I'm surprised that this thread has so many down votes for how liberal reddit is.
Now for Mitt Romney to do an AMA - yeah right!
Where the hell did the almost 14k upvotes go ...?
How would you describe the American relationship with Canada?
Mr. President, chances are you won't get this or will even have time to read this, but I have one question for you. Sorry for being late to the party, but what are you planning on doing about the oil boom in North Dakota? If you had an extra minute I'd love a clear answer, thanks.
I don't even like Obama (I'm a Libertarian), but this earned mad respect from me. Thank you for parting on an objective note, in the interest of democracy, Mr. President.
Doesn't matter who you voted for, being able to ask the president a question on a pretty informal platform is *awesome*.
Why has the national debt grown at an unprecedented  rate under your presidency?
Are you considering more sanctions toward Iran seeing that they are mostly impacting not only the Iranians living in Iran but also the ones living the west?
I do not know if you will read this, but if you do, I want you to know, you are a good man. You have tried to help us, and for that I thank you. 

Also, while I am not a member of the LGBT community, I am very pleased that you have chosen to support them. 

Have a wonderful week.
What are your plans if you lose the upcoming elections?
Holy crap. Posting in the most popular Reddit thread of all time. Imagne if it was 2008 and Bush did an AMA. Imagine!

On a side not, how was the username "PresidentObama" not already taken?
[deleted]
Do you still "inhale frequently"?
Yankees or Red sox?
-edit, disregard that, i forgot you were a white sox guy

what is your favorite thing about being the president?
too bad he'd never answer any questions regarding the useless war on drugs
New Orleans hit by hurricane AGAIN.  

POTUS answers questions on reddit...................

Really?  Reddit and campaigning is the focus right now?
thanks mr president
People, the president is on reddit right now. He could have read your post. Girls of gonewild - the president may have seen your boobies. Tree people - stay safe. People against Obama - you probably got a downvote.
I seriously doubt that you'll answer this but I'll ask anyways. Being a fan of Star Trek, which do you prefer more? Kirk or Picard?
hey mom  i m using reddit!! for the first time in my life. Obama u brought me here!
Posting in an awesome Reddit.

I like the US, it's a great place to visit during my holidays.
I LOVE YOU OBAMA!
Wow I looked at this earlier and it had 14000 up votes, now it only has 9000
The end of the update just secured almost ever single redditors vote just now. Amazing...
Mr. President, as someone who is just entering the workforce after graduating high school, what are some policies/programs being considered to help those trying to go to college? 

Thank you.
What is also awesome, is that when I read the President's posts, I HEAR his voice in my head.

Normally when I read a post, I hear a mixture between my voice and the voice of a deaf Polish war veteran.
thank you Mr.President.

can't believe i missed this :(
I'm an OIF veteran.  I personally witnessed how wasteful our foreign wars are.  Are you going to end the 90+ military bases currently occupying foreign soil as well as our current war in Afghanistan as well as any proxy wars we're currently involved in?

Let me tell you about my squad.  Most of us are medicated.  One of us committed suicide.  Another held his girlfriend at gunpoint after getting back, and I'm facing federal prison time.  The war fucked a lot of us up, and I think you at least owe me a response.
Last Valentine's Day my son made [this card!](http://i.imgur.com/eR5tE.png) for you, and mailed it to the White House.  He's such a little patriot. Anyway, there is probably less of a chance you'll see this here as you would see it from the actual mail, but I thought I'd do this anyway.
Hello , Mr President.
Have you considered putting together a nonpartisan group to audit the individual house and senate committees?

The committee of space science and technology understands neither science nor technology.  The natural resources guys are taking heavy oil lobbying money and ways and means does the same from financial interest groups. I think it would really help restore the people's faith in the legislative branch.

EDIT: Go White Sox! That Youk joke in Boston was awesome
Just want to be a part of history.
Keep up the good work sir
Hello Obama!

Eventhough i'm a brazilian, me and my family admire you and support you. We hope you win the elections in November (Wish we could vote too lol).

Keep on being awesome!
Good evening Mr. President. There my dream is fulfilled.
Any advice for a senior in high school interested in politics?
Greetings from Ulster County, NY! :)
So, Obama's a mac.
Do you think Romney has a chance to win the election, I feel like he has ruined his chances recently.
Any future plans on visting the Republic of Panama? Greetings from the Panama. It's great to see a public figure like you redditing.
This post will go down in history. Thank you President Obama for answering our questions!
Mr President,

How can I get a bottle of your beer???  I'm a brewer and work at an Ohio brewery, one that sadly you haven't dropped into on your travels through our state.
How is your day going?

Following the vote counter for the last few hours. I saw it go from 9000 points to 5800. And the vote has been 50-60% throughout. Can someone please tell me why this AMA is getting so much "mixed feelings" ?
This had probably been said and probably won't get seen, but thank you. Thank you for fighting for women. Thank you for fighting for civil rights. Thank you for fighting for kindness and acceptance. Thank you for fighting for education. Thank you for fighting for what really matters. And thank you for doing this kind of thing. We need to know that our president heard us and this helps.
As someone who was an undecided voter. It's things like this that have helped me lean towards you for this election. You are here taking our questions and giving us one-on-one answers. While Romney is out screaming somewhere trying to give the rich more tax cuts and keep gay marriage illegal. Thank you so much Mr. President. It means a lot to us.
tell me about aliens, obama.
You have my vote, Mr. President! Welcome to reddit!
Are you a batman kind of guy or a superman kind of guy?
Even though I missed him being here...I just want to comment in the same thread as President Obama.  I think it is awesome that President Obama did this.
Do you think team USA would have still won the Olympic Basketball gold medal with you as starting point guard? Because I totally think you could have done it.
How in the he'll did this go from over fourteen THOUSAND up votes to just over five thousand in under an HOUR?! I'd love to see the traffic info during that time.
Ok seriously, what's with all the downvotes?
This was fantastic- what a great way to reach out to America.  I have to say that there were a lot of great questions, and answers, some people asked for things, and a handful of people thanked Mr. Obama for taking time to do this AMA, but did anyone thank him for his last 3.75 years of service?  Agree with his policies or not, the man has worked hard and sacrificed a lot for what is likely and quite literally the most thankless job in America... 

Thank you, Mr. Obama, for being our president.
Mr.President, Do you have any knowledge of the "illumanti"?
Mr President, when does the narwhal bacon?
I didn't see him answer a single question about cats. Come on Mr. President, adopt a kitten. Do it for Reddit.
So this is why i couldn't get on reddit lol. Vote Barack Obama in November!
I wish our government was this awesome in Canada. We love him here. When he visited we gave his family a some poutine and maple syrup... Hope he pulls through in the elections, such a nice guy.
Holy shit, I love Reddit.
What do you have to say in response to Seal Team 6 who have vocalized the disdain and disrespect they harbor towards you, their Commander-in-Chief?
Am I the only one surprised the username PresidentObama wasn't already taken?
I dont belong here im canadian :D
obama is redditor for 2 days and has 15k comment karma........ OH THE GLORIES OF BEING PRESIDENT.
Mr. President- an honor to have you here with us. Reddit keeps crashing due to the large number of people flocking here to speak with you. I appreciate your efforts to make us more energy-efficient, and your efforts to stimulate our economy. And that you're on reddit, well, you might be the coolest President ever!

My question is this: how will you be addressing/acting on land development concerns? It seems that we're losing more and more natural habitat and forests to  increased housing, businesses spreading, etc.
Mr. President, do you have any plans on making marijuana decriminalized or legal if you become re-elected? Dont you think the war on drugs is just one huge failure? I mean people going to prison for marijuana is ridiculous, just regulate like you would with alcohol and have certain areas where it can be done. 
Thanks, 
           Jaybiscut07
What are your plans for the US Military?
I.e. budget, deployments, recruiting, etc.
I want to know what the army will have me doing now that the war is dying down.
Commenting to be a part of history?  I'm like the guy 3 miles away from the inauguration hours after it ended. 

I WAS THERE MAN.
How did you hear of reddit, it did you browse reddit before this AMA?
http://www.wlsam.com/Article.asp?id=2517663&spid
I guess the presidents inner circle doesn't like to pay taxes either...weird.
Mr Obama, 

As a college student it is getting harder and harder to keep up with tuition and college payments. Availability of help in this subject is very small in the urban areas, mine being NYC. Is there any hope to education truly getting more funding and attention? Can the college student hope to see any improvements to the system and not worry about how much of a dent college will put into their life, and consider more what good it will do?
ITS BARACK OBAMA, QUICK SAY SOMETHING WITTY!

Uh, bacon.

choo choooooooooooo
Dear Mr. President

How do you justify killing an American Citizen without a trial?
I know you won't be on here anymore but I do hope you see this.
I am your average upper middle class 21 year old who dreams of becoming a game programmer or writer.
I would love to attend a good online school.
I suffer from social anixety and know that I would be best with online.
Now, I know that there are so many things going on right now. But I would really like to address the cost of college. 
I am no politician and frankly, I know nothing of politics. 
I think everyone should have the opportunity to attend school, but I am afraid to go into so much debt. I know there is probably nothing that can happen, but I just wanted to point that out. I just wish schools were not so expensive. Oh and I know one of your make up artists, Jackie Walker :)

Well Mr. President,

I hope you listened to all of us and take your time to come back and read everyone's messages. I will be voting for you.
Are you only doing this for more votes for the upcoming election?
hello mister president! i would love to ask a few things i want to say
1. is it true that 50% of Americans don't pay any taxes at all, because they have a low income? and if so, how is it fair that my dad had given almost 100,000 dollars in taxes this year?
2. i understand you want to "stimulate" the economy by taxing people with larger incomes, then giving it to people with lower incomes. now this doesn't sound bad in a perfect world. but if people get enough money to get by without working, then why would they work?
3. and finally, i think if business owners and people with large incomes are not taxed to death, they have enough money to hire people. 

i do realize that these are conservative views, and if you want to talk more about politics.. i would be honored to discuss ideas!
How do you intend to achieve "equality" without taking freedoms away from others?
Can you please impeach everyone from the congressional science committee? Seriously around 8 of the members are not scientifically literate whatsoever and they can do serious damage.
Our presidents a redditor?!! WOO-HOO, 4 MORE YEARS!
Sorry for not being a productive participant, but I'm Canadian, and I just want to feel like I'm part of the action...
Thank you Mr. President.
Why did you continue the practice of placing so many former Goldman Sachs lobbyists and executives in positions of power (especially over our financial sector)? It appears that there is a huge conflict of interest here as Goldman Sachs has received federal bailout money (in the double digit billions last I checked) from programs overseen by these same people (Mark Patterson for example). There's also Adam Storch, Gary Gensler, Robert D. Hormats and I believe Dianna Farrell and Philip Murphy also fall into that category.
Did you buy this as Obama really addressing your questions? 
Sorry, this could have been addressed by a staffer with the current poll position.  Did none of you note the lag between question and answer?

Go ahead, down vote me.. this was a farce to appeal to a small base.
I'm downvoting. Simply because this guy has had too many upvotes... yet he talks utter crap.

Here's... to a life without spineless, gutless politicians!
when will weed be legal?
I am upvoting in appreciating the work you and your wife have done in focusing upon the obesity epidemic and setting an excellent example for our nation's youth.
 Sir, I have but one request of you... please do not allow the Republicans push back women's rights and their right to choose on whether to bear a child or not.
   Thank you.
How do you justify all the money you continue to waste?
Mr. President,
As you know, the VP debate is coming to Centre College where I am currently attending. Could get me a ticket so I can support VP Biden in this red state? 

                                                                         Thank you
comment
Paper or plastic?
I applaud this man. Even if people do not like him and say he is a bad president, this boosts my thoughts about keeping him in office. Should he stick to his promises, anyway.
Is it me or shouldn't this go in R/Politics?
6,000 points on first post,
http://imgur.com/6Y2hL
Doing an IAMA is classic Obama!  He and his staff are forward thinking and progressive.  Romney would never think of doing it.
the ONE day I don't fire up reddit in the afternoon.

The one day............/sigh
How did no one make the user name "PresidentObama" already?
I'm afraid I'm a little too late, but I have a request. 
I'm a 21 year old Danish student, who is visiting DC from today until Saturday. What would it take for me to high five you? I'm at the Capitol Skyline Hotel.
Mr. President, what is the ultimate goal of your job?
Why hasn't there been a no-fly zone established in Syr1a, and why has the US kept a distance from intervening militarily?

Also, some would suggest that your comment on the use of chemical weapons being a "red line", gave the regime a green-light to shell cities without consequence or condemnation; what would you say to anyone who believes that?

--

I just want to clarify that we here in Syr1a, particularly those opposed to the killing, have nothing but admiration and appreciation for the continuing financial and strategic aid from the West to the opposition. Especially in a time where your economies aren't as strong as they once were. Hopefully my questions haven't implied the contrary. 

Peace and love,
Ali.
Posting in a historic thread. Although, I do feel like this was done purely to get votes.
If you were drifting in the ocean for a week and all you had left to eat were your two daughters, which one would you eat first?
Is anybody else ready Mr. President's answers and hearing them in his voice?
They gotta put your face on a 5000 bill! That way no Democrats can see it. Well at least Jeezy can afford some of them.
This thread is a joke
I want an AMA of the first redditor to comment on this thread
I don't believe this
Nice try.
Holy shit! Pres. Obama is a redditer and made a meme reference. W/e I'm going to vote for him once he releases that beer recipe.
Keep up the good work! My 8 year old brother has always wanted to know what your most favorite thing to do is.

What is it?
Would you go dickless for Chiklis?
Even as a Canadian I thought that was pretty cool. Let's get Stephen Harper next! ( for all you Americans and other countries that's Canada's Prime minister)
Mr president,
How do you feel about the fact that the federal reserve has been manipulating money by inflation/deflation for almost 100 years in direct violation of the demands of the US Constitution, and the fact that the fat banksters are gazillionaires from this while the rest of us are enslaved by credit and debt that we are forced to use just to survive? More importantly what are you going to do about it, if anything?
Why are we spending so much money on defense and border control against Mexico and cutting public schools?

I'd also personally like to request a moratorium on the blue angels until my niece can get a school book again, or a school lunch, or may be an art/music class.
Mr. President,
Thank you so much for connecting with the people of the United States.  I feel that so many political figures are more concerned with the process itself than with the people they are actually representing, and it is refreshing to see someone take an interest in the public.  I was already going to vote for you, but you definitely got my vote by going on Reddit!
The president has SO much karma now
President Obama includes "NOT BAD!" in his last update.. not bad.
I can't help but wonder if this is really just a photo of Obama in front of a computer and 2000 some odd analysts in a room rapidly deciding the *best* possible answer.
edit: of course it is.. and that's ok.
When are you going to realize prohibition doesn't work? Legalize marijuana and end this civil war we live in. 800,000 American citizens are being incarcerated every year, for what? Smoking/owning a plant? Why make nature illegal? Please, President Obama, please do something about these ridiculious marijuana laws we have today. You were there yourself, you can relate to our situation.
Only 12 days too young to vote this year. My parents say that they are going to vote for Romney... Because he is mormon. That drives me crazy. Ah well. Not my decision.
Work to get us single payer health care and abolish the Citizen's United Supreme Court decision
Why are people still asking questions?
I realize this may be a little late, but what are your views on the way congress and senate can vote for their own payroll raises? Do you think it needs to be changed? If so, what does it need to be changed TO?
I realize this may be a little late, but what are your views on the way congress and senate can vote for their own payroll raises? Do you think it needs to be changed? If so, what does it need to be changed TO?
What are your stances on American debt limit and what are you going to do about it?
Ah, so this is why Reddit crashed when I tried logging on earlier.
If I said something awful and racist, would I get into federal trouble?
I'm only 7 hours and 20000 comments late.
Ron Paul, a great politician or the greatest politician?
I wish it was you... I'm sure it's not though... I have a million questions I'd ask... Like why aren't you out spreading the word to the public about the benifits of universal healthcare??? Why is the only crap I hear about it the junk on FOX??? Why aren't people looking at the friggin hoops teachers have to jump through instead of putting all our faith into standardized testing??? Why are you so silent on this cooperations as people??? And what about the gay rights stuff??? I wish it was you... I wish there was some way we "normals" had a pipeline to truly understand what is going on in the head of the president we stand behind... If only...
Thank you for supporting gay rights. It does not affect me in any way (as of yet) but i still think it's awesome.
Now imagine Romney wins the election and in 4 years he's doing an AMA on Reddit. You'd all just eat it up. That will confirm that most of North America has gone to shit.
Good afternoon sir, troops in the pacific send their support.  Keep your current plan with the military going, these draw-downs are cutting out a lot of slack that we've been ignoring over the last decade.
What is your opinion on the fact that many politicians seem to be so scientifically illiterate?
This isn't related to politics but... What's your favorite drink?
Please invest in fusion energy, I strongly believe that America achieving this would be the moon landing of the 21st century.

Thanks for doing an AMA Mr. President.  

My question is about the American Dream and its attainability in current times.  Most of my life I've followed the formula for success: worked hard, studied hard, went to college, and made a decent career for myself.  I'm lucky to be in my financial situation in this economy, but I still feel like the whole house and 2 car garage thing is a thing of the past.  

I just hit my 30s and totally debt free and even saving a good chunk to go towards a down payment on a home, but looming over me is the overpriced housing market.  Its hard to see myself chaining myself in debt for the rest of my life to pay for a 300,000-500,000 house (I live in the DC Metro area if those numbers seem high for the rest of the redditors who don't live in a major city).  

I'm not from a privileged family or anything.  My parents both came from very humble beginnings without secondary education and were able to attain these things by the time they were much younger than me.  What advice can you give to someone in my position?
You sir did a good job today. I will see you on saturday, I am a resident of sioux city iowa.
Love you, sir!
Thanks for the AMA. Hopefully you will do another term.. And welcome to reddit
Mr. President. All I have to say is that you are an empowering figure in my life, and I'm sure many others.  I voted for you four years ago, and I will be voting for you again. Thank you for all you have done for the poor/middle class,  Aloha kaua! Mahalo nui loa!
Sup Prez.
Mr. President, how does it feel to have crashed the servers of our beloved site?
If I lived in the US I would vote for you. Mitt Romney is a glorified moron, and people don't give you enough credit anymore. Big fan from Canada~
I'll vote for him. This was a pretty good campaign strategy although the far majority of redditors were probably going to vote for him anyways.
Oh my fucking god, how did I miss this? Like I already loved you as a president, but now I love you as a person. You have all of my votes, would that I had more votes to give.
Will you continue to go on reddit after this AMA is over?
Dear Mr. President,

I understand that this isn't how this is supposed to work, but if you are still reading these, would you please take a moment and reply to my comment? I know that this thread already has thousands of comments like mine, but it would truly be something I could tell my grandchildren about. If I could ask you one question, it would be: What  is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word "Canada"? I live there and would like to hear it from you first. 

Sincerely, 
Souperlizard
You made a promise on October 2nd, 2008, why haven't you fulfilled it yet? Do you plan on acting on it?

>"The facts are undeniable. An official policy that calls on diplomats to distort the historical facts is an untenable policy," Obama wrote. "As President I will recognize the Armenian Genocide."
you've got my up-vote
Hi I'm from Canada that's it
Hap-py cake day, mis-ter pres-i-dentttt

Mr. President, will we be seeing another March Madness prediction?
Every time I read responses from him I read it in his voice.
Dear President Obama, would you mind and [read this letter](http://dametora.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=obama#/d4vrujs) my girlfriend made for you? I hope you become more aware of the helpless struggles that people endure that people like you can solve.
Upvoted the POTUS!!!
As a Canadian woman who has been listening to the Republican rhetoric for these last few months, let me just say that I wish I had a vote in this upcoming election.  I will be celebrating your victory in this election as I did 4 years ago.  You got this!
First off let me say Mr. President, you have been an inspiration to me, not only as a fellow american but as a fellow black man. I had the pleasure of voting for you in 2008, the first time I was ever able to in a general election and have since that year had the honor of serving under you as a member of the armed forces of our country. My question is a little personal. As a fellow black man, son of a single mother, father and husband I think we both can agree that the burden on our shoulders to not repeat the actions of our fathers is a heavy one. I would like to know how you managed and what you did to balance your fathering and husband duties with your ambition, career and drive to become a state level legislator, then national legislator, finally to president of our country. Any tips would also be appreciated!
as a european im concerned about the situation in the middle east, especially concerning the us-american position towards the palestinian liberation movement. what should happen there in your opinion, and what are you going to do to achieve that?
Mr.President, how to make a NO WAR earth? human on the earth and inside the earth may be want the earth that no death in war . i see so many innocence civilian die in the war because they are not american citizen!does the war look down upon   normal people in other countries?i know a solution for  stoping the war via "Make Love No War",it seams no work!
Dear Mr. President,

As a Physics major undergraduate at University of California, Davis I am concerned about the current job market for academia and science in general. I always thought I would go on to grad school and eventually get a PhD but the current state of science in American society is more discouraging than ever. With budget cuts to NASA and other science programs I feel - and i know many others feel the same way - that graduate school is starting to look like a waste of time, especially since it doesn't seem to significant increase my chance of getting a job afterwards. What is your view on graduate level education and science in our society? What are your plans for science as an industry for America? How do you think we can fix this problem where science isn't being pursued and encouraged?

Thank you, Mr. President.

P.S. Would you please take 5 minutes of your time to watch this [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbIZU8cQWXc&feature=relmfu) video. I watch it whenever I am doubting my future in science and I feel it sends a very inspiring message about science in America.
I think it was both courageous and incredible that Obama was able to take time out of his schedule to answer questions by completely random and irrelevant people. Not to mention doing it when the race is heating up. What a stand up guy.
Mr. President, what would your administration do if Julian Assange is extradited to the United States? I am almost definitely going to vote for you, but am worried about the precedent that is being set when independent journalists like Assange can be threatened to be arrested for reporting things today in our 21st century where the major networks were not locked up for reporting on Guantanamo Bay. I know you understand the world of media is different now. Can you push for modern legislation to deal with this change in how the world works? Our founding fathers did believe that democracy cannot function if people will be arrested for reporting the facts, I think our history has proven this to be true. Please protect the freedom of the press.

I know you're done answering, but I'm deeply curious. As the first African American POTUS, do you feel any type of special obligation to extend freedom to every minority?

As a gay male, I often think of the African American civil rights movement as a key starting point for the LGBT community.  Stonewall in particular is a fascinating look at our people's history, and the comparisons are uncanny.  

In all honesty, your speech at the 2004 DNC was enough to motivate me to come out of the closet, and your win in 2008 was enough to push me over the edge and come to terms with the fact that even I could be involved (on some level) with the overarching political process and the idea that even I (a poor gay kid from Wisconsin) could one day rise out of the morass of public humiliation and mistreatment that comes with my sexuality.  You helped teach me that I could wear my minority status as a badge of honor, and your win made me point to those that thought I was nothing as an affirmation of a minority rising to the literal top.  There is no one in the world with as much power or responsibility as you, and frankly, the idea that a group of people that I see as one in the same rising to the challenge and electing you was a huge boost of confidence for me.  I guess ultimately a lot of people have a similar story, and their story, your story, our story, are all connected and perfected by a long wave of social injustice and institutionalized racism and sexism finally coming full circle in this country.

Even if you are not elected, sir, you will still have a place with those that are considered lower or less than.  But because of you, I will never be less than again.
What was your first date like with First Lady Michelle Obama?
Mr. President, Germany has a law that requires parents to support their children until they have a degree (or until they are 25 years of age), additionally their universities are subsidized. Would you be willing to invest in education by subsidizing tuition or making all parents support their children through college?
When did it go from 9.5k points to 4000?
The "NOT BAD!" is the cherry on top
I voted for you four years ago.  I'm sorry, but your continued insistence on war, punishing whistleblowers who expose the lawlessness and corruption, killing American citizens abroad, and stripping our civil rights away, I can never in good conscience vote for you again, or Romney, for that matter, out of respect for those illegally detained, tortured or assassinated who never got a trial, or the innocent people who lost their lives in our wars you've continued overseas, and the military service members who were put into harms way for no moral or rational purpose.
When this AMA closed there were +10K upvotes. Now were at 4K? Wassupwiddat?

Please President Obama, Please try, within your power, to raise the minimum wage, Here in NYC it is very hard to make ends meet at minimum wage.
I've been a redditor for almost 7 years and this is the most vindicating post ever.

Who would have thought they would get the President on here.

Amazing.
mr president, how come you let the school system decline me from walking at  graduation? i wanted to do it a year early, but noooooo. we had to let the kids that didnt care walk, i worked my ass off to walk at graduation a year early, i'm still sad :c
Will you please work with Congress to sign at least one federal budget during your time in office?
do you plan on answering any hard questions with anything but empty rhetoric
Yup, Barack's my friend now.
Hi Mr. obama i am from singapore. Thanks :)
Hi Obama! I will vote for you, just want to get a comment in here.
Mr. president I am a citizen concerned with our school systems in mpls,mn it seems that school funding is being cut back forom necessary departments such as transportation to field trips but the state is funding programs like "pray away the gay" that demonize and dehumanize our friends family (including our children) coworkers...please help me to understand how this is ethical, leagal and what u can do as my prospective president to fix this
Ps. My vote for you this election rides not only on a resolution ut also a successful implementation process. This issue is more important to me then the marriage amendment in MN right now and im a gay man
Great initiative answering questions Mr. President.
The one time I wish Reddit didn't have the downvote system. Im really curious to see the real number of downvotes on his comments!
keep up the good work
Just wanted to say thank you for speaking at CSU yesterday Mr. President, I was unfortunately unable to attend because the ticket line was extremely long, but I appreciate you branching out to my college campus. Especially after speaking at CU Boulder.

Go Rams
Please don't move the Chargers to LA.. please
President Obama, how do you feel about Proposition 32 in California?  It is a proposition that essentially forces unions and corporations to be barred from political funding, yet allows CEOs and other persons with power in those organizations to fund through themselves without any restriction.

Dear President Obama,
I live in Canada so I can't vote for you, but as a Canadian what happens in the USA especially economically effects us here. There has been much talk of the Keystone TransCanada pipeline and PM Harper has cut back on environmental assessments to get this pipeline and other pipelines in place faster despite opposition from many local groups. 
My question to you is this: in your second term as president, what will you do to make sure that the oil which is purchased from other countries has had the proper assessments and safety standards to ensure that they are environmentally sound?
Everybody has hard pressing questions and concerns with you, but i just wanted to say thanks for this. You have no idea what it means to us who would normally have no chance to speak with you. Best of luck in November my fellow american!
Who diwnvotes this shit?
Mr. President, do you plan to make it more difficult for gun owners in America? I heard gun control is your next big platform. If true, why would you take tools used for self defense away from law-abiding citizens?

Mr president, if you get Relected, do you honestly believe you can buy your way out of this depression? Or do you have another plan?

I'm sorry, President of where?
Obama do you think were going to be any better with the economy in near future? My dads job just isnt enough to support our family anymore and all my college savings that i saved had to go into helping him keep up with the bills. Really its hard with the gas prices, healthy foods prices rise (forcing us to get cheap ramen other unhealthy things) electric getting high, insurances, etc. My dads a pilot he can hardly support 2 kids, and wife. It really stresses him out to like he is constantly worried and deep in debt. Plus his health care really sucks his copay is high and he is in debt with only 2 hospital visits that cost him 2000$ for e.r. We cant even afford to go to emergency room if we needed to. Please can you give us any sort if relief even just gas prices anytime soon. Its so difficult.
Reddit, though it's buried in here, all the way from EU i say congrats, it will never get bigger than this, you have just interviewed the most powerful man on the planet.
And in Italy we have old farts who doesn't even know how to turn on a PC...
Not one mention of Bradley Manning in the top comments.  Total avoidance of marijauna questions.  No mention of illegal wiretaps or monitoring.  A single reference to wikileaks from Keepthepace.

Mr. President, I am one of the many millions of people that Airsoft in the United States, and Governor Brown is trying to pass a bill to basically ban Airsoft in the Los Angeles area of California, and many of us have put many hours and much of our hard-earned money into Airsoft, and we would hate to see that go to waste. So please, speaking for everyone in the Airsoft community, please do whatever you can to not get that bill passed.

Thank you for your time.
Mr President, do you use the mouse with your left hand? If so, do you have the buttons reversed? (Although it might sound like a stupid question, I am curious because due to hand trauma I had to use the mouse with my left hand, but it was impossible to use the mouse buttons reversed)

Cheers from Romania
What a pleasure it was to have you on Reddit Mr President. Thank you and best of luck for the elections.

Mr.President, why don't you visit Minnesota? And good luck winning the election.
Mr. President, 
 First I would like to say I am sorry for not reading through the comments to see if this was already asked, but what do you plan to do to help lower college tuition for university level, as well as community level. I myself was at Shenandoah University. My tuition for just one semester was close to 60,000 dollars. My current tuition costs for community college (which is Yavapai College in Arizona) is around 12-15 grand (I have not looked at the final number.) In my opinion, I can see that the job crisis (or Armageddon as my father would put it) can tie directly with this issue.
As nifty as this is, it's almost just a joke, considering how there will be zero tough questions based on reddit's general political views.... I've noticed a pattern in Obama's publicity recently. 

Don't downvote me :(
Mr President, Im not sure if you will be returning to this to answer some more questions but I still want to ask you something. I am a young American living abroad and still getting involved in politics and voting. What is your thought on having the younger generations getting involved in Washington? I feel that, on some topics, the younger generations have a better idea of what is best. I would like to see young citizens who are interested in politics and being a civil servant to try and make America and the world a better place more involved in Washington. Perhaps you could invite some and hear their opinions and ideas? The younger generations are the future of this country, they deserve to be heard.
How do you feel with kim jong un having talks with china? Any concerns or hopeful outcomes to come of the talks?
The price of gold in dollars has about doubled in price since you took office. Does the massive decrease in value of the US dollar as compared to this precious mineral (on which we based the value of our money previously) concern you? Is this a sign of more inflation to come?
With the Palestine/Israel situation there have been many many incidents of American citizens with Arab roots being mistreated but the United States Embassy over there doesn't do anything about them. Whats your opinion on this sir?

Yeah, everyone wants to ask questions but I'll add:

What do you think is the biggest problem with American politics?
AMERICA, VOTE FOR THIS MAN! (from Britain)
Why so many down votes?
My question is about Marijuana, wouldn't legalizing it and taxing it pull us out of this ever growing debt?  You have my vote if you can make this happen.  People are going to smoke weed whether it is illegal or legal.  Wouldn't you rather it create jobs, increase revenue, eliminate cartels, and   also be regulated?
I will say this. Obama is a human being, and has really tried his hardest to keep that image. We know his big ideas really could never take off, but at least he presents himself damned well.
Me thinks people are signing up for Reddit just to downvote.
Most important lesson learned:

He [DID](http://i.imgur.com/5AH5V.jpg) achieve something during his presidency
I am sure this will get buried in a sea of comments, never to see the light of day, but I just want to thank you Mr. President. This AMA has been insightful and I speak on behalf of the Reddit community in saying thank you.
President Obama, I've always wanted to ask you this particular question. What do you do in your leisure time?
Since when do 10,000+ upvotes turn into 3699? Doesn't Reddit support that many digits?
only 3.7k up votes? Probably a lot of republicans here.... >.<
oh hey, i can post a question now...cool...

To President Obama and all the fine folk of the United States of America, l say this as a Non-US citizen; Thank you!

This has been such an amazing experience, l am utterly astounded by the level of pure awesome in this AMA, something that is completely unheard of in my country, a leader as exalted as President Obama who takes the time to converse with his people, it is truly a remarkable experience.

Americans, do not lose this fine gentleman as your President! When November comes, go vote! Do what is best for your country AND the world, the international community needs his great leadership just as much as you do. Vote!

Mr. President I am currently enrolled in college as a music educator and will one day hopefully be a band director. Music is an important part of anyone's life and had been proven to increase a students gpa and test scores but thanks to acts like no child left behind funding for music and the arts in general has been dramatically cut and schools are dropping music and art programs completely.

So my question is this:if re elected do you have any plans to increase school funding for the arts? If so, what are they?
Mr. President, how do you like your steaks cooked?
Why did you not close Guantanamo?.....
Mr President, how do you feel on the banning of guns? As a fifteen year old male, part of my experience of growing up is spending time with my father, uncle, and grandfather hunting. I know many people abuse the 2nd Amendment by committing horrendous crimes on the American public, and banning guns would help to solve this issue, but that would also leave many families at a loss for food. I would very much like to know your ideas on tackling this subject. Thank you for your time.

Pride or prejudice ?
Late to the game here, but I'd like to know how there isn't anything more important for our president to do than an AMA on Reddit.  I understand that it's an election year, but answering questions from a largely liberal forum is just not that helpful in my eyes...
WHere are the JOBS BRO??
What will be your first course of action if re-elected and how will you accomplish it?
Mr.President, I just hope you continue to take the time to do things like these if you're re-elected and not just because elections are near. It truly shows your interest in the people of the United States and what we have to say. Good luck on the upcoming election and know that you have some votes from Texas.
Mr President,

What will you do to prevent patent law from stifling innovation in our country. With the recent ruling that Samsung owes Apple a billion dollars for a couple basic features on smart phones it's becoming clear that our patent laws are going to set us back decades if we don't fix them soon. Technological innovators are going to be afraid to do anything in the United States for fear of multi-million dollar lawsuits. Will this be addressed in your second term, if so, how?
I'm a little bummed that, not only did I miss this, but that the proof pic wasn't of Obama doing his happy face while holding up a piece of paper that had 'HI REDDIT! AMA =) 2012' written on it.

Hello Barack, my husband is handicapped.  He has been wheelchair bound since he was 17. He has a central nervous system disorder that has been destroying his balance and coordination. The ONLY medicine that works for him is marijuana. It helps his coordination,  balance, pain, and depression.  We both do our research and know that marijuana is purely good medicine. Not only is it good medicinally it is also good for many other things that could help fix our economy.  I want to know why you do not bring the facts out to the media and give marijuana a fare chance to be legalized?
This is a complete fucking joke.  He dodged every important question and answered complete fluff.  God, American politics are the biggest joke.  I am fucking ashamed right now.

Mr. President, given our massive debts to China, do you feel as though we have lost or hegemony, or are we still the locus of power. Further, if tensions continue to rise in the middle east and southwest Asia, will China be the one to follow in our footsteps?
What would you do about the fact that many people don't think the two party system works anymore? How would you change the electoral process so more people would be inclined to trust it?
I just want to say thank you for supporting women's rights and equality for everyone. <3

Mr. President, first I would like to thank you for this opportunity.  My question is, Can you please allay my fears about trapwire and indefinite holding without due process?
Mr President....when are you going to start stressing  the importance of having a majority government so you can get done what you have set out to do? I think this needs to be your primary campaign message. 

Sometimes in life...all you have to do is ask.
This is a good ama, even though i am not american i enjoyed reading through his answers. Too bad he only had 30 minutes to stay and chat, would have loved to see more questions answered.
I can't believe I am posting this and a little scared to do so, but I am a mother of a Gay son. I have been watching the election debates and noticed that Mitt Romney (hate that first name BTW) anyways that he is not for Gay rights or even acknowledges it. I noticed he is a SO CALLED christian too. Being a mother and a christian of a Gay son, my eyes have been opened up to many debates myself. Being judged all around even from my own family is hurting ( i will admit). My question is: if you are re-elected will you stop the racism of Gays or are you feeling the same as Mitt Romney does? I have noticed throughout our history that more Christian's then non-Christian's seem to be judgmental/raciest towards things they can't comprehend or control. First it was Indians, second Africa Americans, third women right, now Gay rights! When will it ever end? No one has a right to judge another, only God has that right....right? Sorry just a concerned mother worried about her son's future. Are you the RIGHT person to vote for? Also I am a poor graphic designer/teacher with no health care, if re-electing you, will I become homeless and sick? Please think of us VERY POOR LITTLE PEOPLE when you sit at that desk in that white house... Thank you, for allowing me to express my thoughts, Good Luck in your life:)
Mr. President: Why isn't the Justice Dept. more aggressive on prosecuting voter suppression and other voting rights violations in states that do not require court oversight? Why can Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan (and its obscene dictatorial law), and other states get away with disenfranchising minority, disabled, young and elderly voters?
220,000 upvotes. Mr. President, you can use this for your election.
Mr. Obama president guy, Do you believe that if we start investing into alternative energies more that we will be able to drive down oil costs, increase our 'green output' on the earth, and then the chain that sets off in the market of transportation and whatnot could help the economy as a whole? If so, why aren't we seeing more in the media about these advances? If not, you should rethink that.

If you see this, thank you President Obama. 
Although I support Ron Paul and his Lack of Government, lack of Spending, Lack of Hand holding style; I appreciate you for being a good Democrat and better then most presidents out there. I'm 25 and work hard for my money and I feel you were looking out for me,The Middle Class, regardless of my Gender/Race. Even though I am not a Democrat, I have been proud of you and your accomplishments, wishes/goals because you ARE A Democrat and you ARE trying to do the best with your style of Politics. You ARE a man of the people who you support in your speeches.

If Ron Paul doesn't make it on the Ballot, I'll be voting for you as a Lib/Repub.

You actually spoke out against the Religious Wing nuts about the Sermon on the Mount and I respect you whole heartily. The Naysayers asking for your birth certificate, and pushing on you about your religion were down right RUDE and obnoxious. Those people don't deserve the respect you've given them, but you have a kind heart to keep on.

 I know you won't hear this enough from Republicans, but I like you and Proud to have you as my president. You were probably one of the better presidents of my time/My Generation. You, Who tried to clean up after Rich Spoiled Religious White Kid Status that America was in with Bush. I don't even think of Bush and The Republicans running against you AS Republicans, they are pretenders. They are worthless and Home invading. You on the other hand, show class and respect for all. You even challenge your own when they get just as stupid as the stupid people who call themselves republicans when they are not.

You have a good day and I hope for the best. I will be attempting to serve in the Armed forces once I lose weight and they take me (I'm 270lbs, they want me at 190lbs for my height). I hope to get some military in my background, then see if I can go into some programs for school for politics and sociology so I may one day become a politician myself, if I see the problems in our country, are not getting resolved.
President Obama sir, 
I am 15 years old and I am in the US on a green card. We moved here for my dads job. And I know you will not see this, but I am writing it anyways.

I hope to god that you win the election. I go to a school that is very narrow minded and is about 95% Republican, (and I am low balling it) and I am one of the only democrats. But of course when I voice my opinions I get things such as " you aren't american, your opinion doesn't count", "go back to Europe!", "no one cares what you think, you aren't even american". I still fight on and voice my opinions. It also helps that a young man my age is on my side. And he is destined to be president. Its amazing. He is so good at debating and speeches. I swear put him in front of a room full of republicans for 10 minutes and you'd have over half of them agreeing with him and having Democratic views on things by the end of it! Which gives me hope in my school.

I also want to tell you that I applaud everything you do. I am so happy you are the president. People seem to blame you for the economy and say america has gone down hill. But I can see the amazing changes you have done. I can see the way you have helped the people. They should be grateful to have such an amazing president. I think sometimes they just disagree and cause problems, just for the sake of it. I do not understand why they are so against "Obama-care" , do they not understand. This is the UNITED states of america. The people should be united. They shouldn't want to continue with the health care the way it is. Having hundreds die because they cannot afford an operation or medication. That is insane. They seem to find these things out and just say "Oh how sad!" or "Oh that poor man/woman". Yet they do not want something to help them? I cannot find the logic in it. They seem to think that their money will be paying for everyone. But don't they get that it works both ways? If they need the help, they will get it. If they had a family member or friend who needed help, it would help save their lives? It makes no sense to me. I know that I am 15, and people may mock me all they want, but I am not an idiot. I understand. I have my own opinions. I also am shocked they do not seem to care about all the jobs you have created. Yes unemployment is still bad, but it IS getting better. They seem to be all pissy because you didn't come into office and BAM instantly make the economy fantastic. It wasn't just Bush that caused these problems. Many factors went into it and many presidents who made mistakes. You have been doing everything you could. It isn't your fault bills weren't passed that would of boosted the economy. I really hope you get the second term in office. Because those four more years will give you the time to fix things and do everything you said you would. No body could fix an economy that bad in only four years. And it is going to take years and years to make this economy what the american people want it to be. You are just the begging. Presidents after will also have to deal with this. Democrat or Republican. The same economy is needed to be fixed. Hopefully they will make correct decisions. But for right now, in my opinion, America needs you as their president. And I sure as hell hope they realize that.
Also I also love what your wife is doing. No other first lady has cared as much as she does about the health of american youth. I know if she continues Childhood Obesity will decrease dramatically and maybe someday be a thing of the past.

This has already been extremely long. And you most likely will not see this. But Mr.President, in my opinion (as useless as it may be) is America is lucky to have a man like you as their president. And i hope they see that and elect you again. You are inspirational, intelligent, and also a pretty damn good singer. :)
Sir, if I could be president, I would strive to be like you.
Good luck with everything ahead of you, and may the odds be ever in your favour.
obama, as a canadian i want to say i love obamacare. i hope you get voted into office again. if i was in your lovely country, you'd have my vote. you did a lot of good for that country. it was in ruins when you were elected due to a certain someone *cough bush cough*, but you did your best to fix the issues. rock on!
I just found out about this. I wish I had the opportunity to throw this thought at President Barack Obama: I never volted Democrat but always knew when my vote was wasted. I will be wasted again.

As one of millions of U.S. citizens foreclosed on our homes, I believe that the best way to continue your mandate and ensure your commitment on helping Americans, would be a program to put people back in their own homes or similar ones.

Remember that the foreclosed homes have been resold for as little as, in some cases, 25% of their actual value or previous mortgage.

Now, we, the foreclosed ones, have a huge RED X in our reports.

While I understand that this would be seen as just another hand out, a freeze in previous mortgages would have been a better solution to the housing situation than the humongous financial hole it created. But, ... how could anyone foresee the crater?

Anyways, a program to allow foreclosed people to re-enter lengthy (40 years?) mortgages with little or no money would revitalize the housing market and bump American confidence. Please keep in mind that many of us, myself included, are or have been unemployed for quite a while.

Count me in as one of the first back under a roof of my own (family of 5).

First you introduce the ability as the President of the United States to use the Blackberry against all prior precedents, and now you embark upon such a trendy site and speak directly with the people on the same platform as every other common person.

Quite the unexpected President you are, sir!
CHEESE FOR EVERYONE
Sorry I missed your AMA, I only just found out you were here, but welcome to Reddit. I'd just like to say this was a brilliant move on your part. By hosting this AMA you have just intimately familiarized yourself with a massive community who will now seriously consider voting for you just because you reached out to them. I am guessing you will never see this but if you do I'd like you to know this was a brilliant move and this is coming from someone who does not agree with most of your policies or ideals. Thank you so much for talking with us and please forgive the ridiculously inappropriate questions or comments posed by my fellow Redditers.
Is the oval office chair the most comfortable you've ever sat in?
Hello Mr Obama!

What are your arguments of why you think marijuana should stay illegal?
Posted in this thread for global historical value.
"This Seat Is Taken" Let's make this on a T-Shirt for your re-election! Glad you tweeted last night. Stand up to R and R and let's get rid of their nonsense! You are a GREAT President!
" This Seat Is Taken" " This seat is Taken"  Keep that in mind all the time Mr. President. I will too! That seat is taken! What extra can I do, to save that seat for you?
Why are there so many downvotes on this?
i downvoted it and now two days later reddit shows i upvoted it,  how its happened?

How are we allowing those in congress & the senate to participate legally on "insider trading"? They already make more than 95% of Americans and are allowed to invest on stocks and commodities knowing information not privileged to the public via lobbyist & future legislation.
One question I thought of while watching the GOP, What are some policies that this administration put into action that the republicans will take credit for because it worked while they held office?
Mr.president, will you ever be making a rage comic?
Did your stance on the drug war change due to money, political pressure, or both?

forgive me for my previous comment Mr. President, it was disrespectful and you do deserve respect regardless.
For all of you who asked the president to make marijuana legal here is how you can give him the levers to pull. 
please support house resolution 2835 http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2835/show
click support on the right hand side to send a letter to your representatives. It also wouldn't hurt to email Kathleen Sebelius the H.H.S secretary. 
This bill would prohibit federal interference in state-run medical marijuana programs. It would also move marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II drug, recognizing marijuana's medical value
oh

Canada loves you.  In a country where the Republicans wouldn't exist and the Democrats would be even more left, we love Barack Obama.
I just have one question.  
How are you going to battle the Republican rhetoric?  How will you expose their untruths?
I love how your campaigns have refused to lower you to their fighting style.  You really know how to turn the other cheek and it's egg in the face of your opponents when they expose themselves like this.
What's it like being president?
You're african american, I'm latino. We have faced segregation and violence against us in the country of freedom. Anti-latino laws have been enacted in several states. However, our work force (legal or illegal) moves America's economy forward as it was the case of thousands of african americans during years of slavery. African americans were not paid or poorly paid. Now, we are no paid or poorly paid. It means latinos are the new negroes. Will this continue? What will you do to guarantee the civil rights and human rights of all those hispanos living on American soil?
Polls show that 80% of the American public are against our horses going to slaughter.  The Ag Appropriations Act you signed last year had the language to defund USDA inspections of horse meat.  As a senator you had stated you were against horse slaughter.  What can you do at the executive level to protect our horses?  Why despite thousands of calls, emails and letters from horse advocates and from Congressmen have you not addressed this issue?
How do you justify your orders of the execution of a United States citizen without any trial?
Hello Mr. President,

I know the odds of actually getting a reply are so astronomical as to be impossible, owing to your busy schedule and job, but I wanted to ask this anyway.

I often look at politics, especially the politics in the house and senate, and get very frustrated with both sides when they are seemingly unwilling to compromise on anything. Both sides seem to think that they are intellectually or morally superior to the other and never give ground. It ends up being so difficult to get anything done.

What will you, or even, what -can- you do to bring both sides together? What can you say that will bring Republicans to your side, without falling back on the "I am right and you should agree with me" argument that others use? What can you do to bring Democrats to a compromise with Republicans? Sometimes I think both sides just need to drop their pride and, even if a measure isn't perfect or exactly what they wanted, get something done.

Thank you, sir. I am a Republican, but I respect your leadership and your values, and I thank you for serving our country!
Mr. President, if you become elected for a second term will you be more of a bad ass than you were your first term?
I love u, Mr. Barack Obama. Definitely, you shall win the September Election. May God bess you!!

This might sound weird, but I would love Obama to mention Star Trek one day. I think we have a lot to thank ST for (and science fiction in general), in terms of opening people's minds, combating racism and bigotry.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwAA4Ws3qZs&t=1m56s

In Deep Space Nice, captain Sisko is black. Indeed, many command-level characters are black. In series 6, in an episode called "Far Beyond the Stars", the main characters play writers for a Sci-Fi magazine in the 1950's. Sisko's novella about a black captain of a space station is refused publication - because the main authority figure is black. The episode is a brilliant reminder of how far we have come - and how science fiction often leads the way.

In the subsequent Star Trek series, the captain is a woman.

It's a shame Star Trek isn't going anymore... there is always a great deal to examine and critique about ourselves, and GOOD science fiction is one of the best ways of doing it within popular culture. We need more of the good stuff!
So when is the next AMA?
What are you going to do about education and jobs ?
If this post dropped below 51% percent upvotes, would you be forced to change it back?
Regardless of your political beliefs, Obama will go down as the first president to pioneer the internet.

Posting to look back and all that.
President Obama,

Literally nothing matters when compared to the threat that climate change poses to our nation and the world.  When will you begin recognizing that climate change will change humanity as we know it and work towards moving away from a carbon based economy?  This means stoping oil subsidies, stopping offshore drilling, etc.

Thanks,

Claude

Mr. President.

I am a life long republican. I voted for McCain and GW Bush. I don't think that Bush was a horrible person or even a terrible president. That said:

I have never been a fan of many of the policies of the democratic party. This includes those of your administration.

However, these past four years, I can honestly say that I can no longer ethically vote for the republican party.

I am sure with your team of advisers that you are aware in this shift. Many who voted republican in the past can no longer do so with a clear conscience.

Not to be rude, but what we are left with is you and your administration.

You don't have to win our vote, as the republican party is doing that for you.

How do you feel about this? Do you feel happy that people are coming over to "your side"? Are you saddened that one of the only two parties that are majorly represented is failing its constituents?

What would you say to a voter who cannot ethically vote for their party, but doesn't like the policies of the person who is clearly the better candidate?

In a time where our country is not in the best shape its been, its hard for voters like me who feel that they have no one to really turn to. What we need is some sort of confidence boost that it will get better. How would you recommend we get that boost?

Hello, President Obama. My question is in regards to the very hot button issue of the size of Mitt Romneys face.
A recent poll released showed that while approval of the size of your face is at a fairly comfortable 74%, approval of the size of Mitt Romneys face is at a dismal 7%. In addition, McGill University just conducted a multi-million dollar study that confirmed that your face is indeed normal, while Mitt Romneys face is very little.
I think us here on Reddit and throughout the nation are curious how you think this will affect the overall outcome of the election. Will Mitt Romneys little face hurt him in the end? His campaign continues to be tight-lipped on the issue, and we would like to hear your input.

So how come over 200,000 people don't like that the president offered to answer some questions from the general public? It's one thing to not like him, it's one thing to not like his answers...but why would anyone downvote the original AMA post?
I can finally upvote this post.

How this only has 3,500 points is beyond me.

What a clever way to appeal to the younger generation.  That and Romney/Ryan are plagues on this country and if elected will orchestrate the demolition of the middle class as well as basic human rights.

Obama 2012, seriously people vote.
Mr. President, I'm 12 years old and I'm sure you wont see this comment (due to all of the other comments) but I would like to ask you, whats your thoughts on the new 'slang' yolo? it mean you only live once. but it's very irritating to us redditors.

Mr President

Half an hour my ass, you can't just leave Reddit, even i you are quite possibly the coolest person alive. you'll be on here forever, just looking at pictures of cats.
123,418 people (currently) are ungrateful. You will never see Romney doing an AMA. Whether or not you agree with this man, a downvote is disrespectful. At least Barack joined the conversation.
How do you keep a level head and continue to put out cool, well-formed responses while receiving so much bile and lies from the other side?
For something of this magnitude i think that Reddit should do an announcment! This is huge :D
Mr. President, 

First of all, thank you for doing an AMA - this is very cool.  I was looking for live video of a press conference today and didn't see anything listed, so I'm very happy to be able to ask a question directly online.

If you had to list them in order, what would you say are going to be your top 5 priorities during your second term as president?

Thank you very much!
Would you make at least one political damaging (even if slightly) statement or opinion, simply as as sign of honesty? This is very refreshing from a politician.
President Obama, What is the biggest Republican misconception that you would like to get clarified for the voting public? Thanks for coming on Reddit...Best of luck for 2012, I know you have my vote!
I'm a Ron Paul supporter and even I thought it was awesome that the President of the United States did this... This really shows a lot about his character. More politicians need to continue this trend.
Well, this was disappointing
What are your opinions on legalizing marijuana in a similar fashion to alcohol? Give any negative or positive, literally anything. This is an issue that many people would love to see your opinion on, not because of the result but because you answering would validate it as a question. Answer?
I don't think there's anything more awesome than seeing the President of the United States do an AMA. Any bets that this stays at the top page of Reddit for the next four years? Ha ha.
Mr President, I love you. Thank you for your support of the LGBT community!
Mr. President, you're an inspiration.
Congress is our problem, *not* President Obama.
He is an amazing man who is trying for our country- it took a while and will take longer for everything to go into effect but just have hope. 
I was unemployed for, god too long, but I now have a full time job with benefits (4 months in yay!) I know some of you might read this and say wow how pathetic, but I'm happy to be working. This isn't at all what I want to do for the rest of my life (I'm very much hoping to start college next year for Early Childhood Education.) but it's definitely what I need now. I need it to survive, to keep myself mentally healthy as well as physically, and to get to where I'd love to get to. 
They're called baby-steps for a reason, sometimes a country has to take them as well. We've come so far and have accomplished so much in such a short amount of time. It's sad to see people so cynical everyday :/ 
Times are stressful, there will always be that for some reason or another, just relax for one moment and breath. Be calm. And tomorrow do your damned best to be happy for everything we do have and take notice in the things that have gotten better :)
He's gone, you guys. ._.
Stop asking questions.
After reading through the majority of these posts, my pride in being a conservative has grown exponentially.
Thanks for responding to all of the safe, prescreened comments Mr. President. Your answers have been of little substance as usual and at best the typical political double speak.

Hey, Obama-bro! Legalize weed plz? Thanks.
This will probably get buried, but does your administration have any plans to legalize and tax marijuana? If not, why? I'd be willing to bet that marijuana legalization would guarantee your reelection (not to belittle any other issues at hand). Given that you're the president you probably are already aware of the huge revenue that legalization and taxation would generate, as well as the relief it would provide to the overcrowded prison system and overworked law enforcement, as well as taking money away from the cartels wreaking havoc at our border. The medical benefits of marijuana speak for themselves. I try very hard to look at this issue from a non-biased point of view, and it just seems like there's no logical reason marijuana should be illegal. I'm sure you're also aware that when you were first elected and the White House put up that web page where citizens could submit issues they felt were most important, marijuana legalization was at the top of the list, yet it was never even mentioned or paid attention to. It seems tthe overwhelming majority of Americans want marijuana legalized, so why has the U.S government continued to ignore the issue and refuse legalization?
I wish we had such an amazing leader here in the UK.
Pretty sad I missed out on this.
Hi obama. 


And all the people scrolling through the new comments here.
Thank you, Mr. President, for taking the time to do this. I don't have much to say or ask, but I'm sure this community will.

Have you brought about as much change as you'd hoped to?

I want to know what you will be doing in office if you get re elected and how it will help/affect small businesses. Also I'd like to know what you think of our nations primary education
How do you feel bankrupting this country?

How do you justify theft in the form of taxes?

Why is healthcare even an issue for you?
Mr. President,

Real simple. Why is marijuana illegal when Cigarettes, Alcohol, High Fructose Corn Syrup,  and Processed Meat are legal? 

ThankYa
Mr. President,

I'm not a supporter, and I won't be voting for you. 

Having said that, I just want to thank you for doing this AMA.
How do you feel about your opponent's sense of humor?
Do you sleep well even after being briefed on citizens being tortured for America's foreign policy objectives? Be it in Gitmo or by one of our many shady allies.
How do you cope with the illogical people you are against and with? 

What plans do you have for transparency?
Still using a BlackBerry?  Would hope the President would have moved to another platform by now ;)

Posting in legendary thread.
Have you tried /r/spacedicks?
I have one question, one shot to ask the president anything I can think of...:

What is your favorite Shel Silverstein poem?

Phew! Glad that's off my chest!

Thanks for doing this!
How do you stay in touch with your family when you're campaigning so often?

And what are you looking forward to more this fall: college football or the NFL?
Best of luck, Mr. President. Here's to (hopefully!) another 4 years.
what are you thoughts on Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Freddy Mercury, and Neil Patrick Harris?
Welcome to Reddit sir.  Canadian here in Toronto, Ontario.

My question for you is, Star Trek or Star Wars?
will you push to legalize marijuana? :)
So how does it feel being President?
What's something that you have to do that you never thought a president would have to do?
Mr. President, with all the lies and obstruction of the Republican party and certain news media, do you have any regrets being our President?
It's a shame he only answered useless questions.

The questions i would have liked to have him answer would be:

1: Why do you insist on supporting Israel even tho they are commiting crimes against humanity? Was not USA about peace and freedom? 

2: Why do you let religious retards have a place in the senate? 

3: What will you do about the poverty in USA? Why spend so much money harassing Iraq when you could have saved so many in your own country?

4: Why do you not create stricter rules for your massmedia so that people like Bill O'Reilly can't lie on tv and make your people more ignorant than they already are? I don't mean everyone.

5: Why is abortion still a debate? 

6: The police brutality has taken a turn for the worst. Now you can't even film the police when they commit crimes. Do they stand above the law?
It's disheartening that over 150,000 people would downvote this.  Why?
Are you watching the Paralympics? Who is your all-time favorite person with a disability?
What colour is your toothbrush?

Uh, whatever. You people will just softball questions.

This will be one of the least informative interview of him ever.
With so much talk about working across party lines and working in a bi-partisan compromising fashion, in your opinion why has a presidential candidate or incumbent never reached across party lines for their vice presidential candidate?
How does one deal with racism repackaged as policy and political disagreements? Is this something that you are used to dealing with? What would you say to encourage people struggling with recent events, work, unemployment, moral concerns?

-everyone should love a good presidential peptalk
Mr. President, first of all I want to tell you thanks on a personal level.  I met the woman who would become my wife during your inauguration; she was so inspired by you that she came all the way up to DC from Houston and wound up in a random dive bar seated next to me.  We began talking, hit it off, and the rest is history.

As for my question: do you regret reaching out to the right as much as you did, instead of taking a more aggressive/confrontational tone?  From my perspective, every time you reached across the aisle, your hand was swatted away.

Thank you very much for your service, and I look forward to celebrating four years of knowing my wife at your second inauguration.
I heard you smoked a lot of weed back in your teenage days, so why arent you advocating the legalization of marijuana as the president?
Hi Mr. President- as the father of two girls, what is the best piece of parenting advice you could give? Thanks!
How are you enjoying this season of Breaking Bad?
Its clear the President did this AMA for a reason. If he is going to win he is going to need everyone of his supporters out there voting. Reddit has a large population of Obama supporters so lets make sure we listen to him and get out and vote!
Where are all these downvotes coming from? There are 141,525 Republicans on Reddit? I smell Romney
This is going to be buried, but just to sooth my own conscience: This was a terrible AMA. It was like TV ads playing a script after each question. 1. state "that's why we" and then tell something that is a bragging point and then 2. turn the response into "that's why we need to" and talk about some proposed legislation.

But the really good questions were never answered, and the answers show that our president has been co-opted by lobbyists and political concerns, and isn't going to answer questions about ACTA.

**TL;DR: Campaign publicity stunt. Stop eating the propaganda.**
Hey... did anyone ever realize that the questions were probably staged (just think about how bogged down the website was)... I.e. his staff created accounts ahead of time, they posed questions, he phrased answers, and they both just copy+pasted when they could get a sliver of bandwidth?
How do you feel about libertarian candidate Gary Johnson?
Why have you dramatically increased drone strikes, and why did you target US Citizens, including a now murdered teenager, with them?
Seriously, I demand to know who downvotes the President?  We are a liberal group here...how are there even 151,669 people on Reddit who dislike the President enough to downvote?  NDT got in the range of 7000-8000 upvotes and granted, I know the guy is good, but the President of these damn United States made an effort to connect with us and he got downvoted?  Tell me this is a trick of Reddit.
What economic relief do you plan to bring for middle-class America that is too well-to-do for government handouts, but not well enough for upper-class tax breaks?
What gets you out of bed each and every morning?
Boxers or briefs?
Mr. President, 

I recently heard that the White House installed a brewery. What kinds of beer will be brewed, and what is your personal favorite style of beer?

P.S. I really appreciate the job you're doing, keep up the good work, you have my vote in November in Indiana!
What is your current personal (not political) opinion of marijuana?
What Operating system are you using
Sir,

I don't think you've ever been asked this on the record: A lot of reports during the healthcare reform debate indicated that your former Chief of Staff may have brokered an early deal with the healthcare industry to assure they would not stand in the way of reform if the Administration did not push for the Public Option.  Is this true? Do you regret not working harder to push for the Public Option, seeing as the watered-down reforms we actually got were nonetheless portrayed in the right-wing media as Communism Gone Wild?

Thanks ~ go win this thing.
President Obama, how do you feel about the current nature of the two-party system? Do you personally feel that the country would be better off without the electoral college, or some other changes that would allow the introduction of other parties into the mainstream?
Who is your best friend (not family) and how has the time commitment of being POTUS impacted that friendship?
Just wanted to say thank you for attempting to do this President Obama! There should be more communication with the people and our elected officials.
Do you have an opinion on the concept of a "Just War"?

Do you think that any of the wars that our country has been involved in in the last 50 years have been just?

Can you send a drone out to kill /u/iamawhalesexologist for me? He is kind of a jerk.
Mr. President, welcome to Reddit.

Why do states that vote for the legalization of medicinal marijuana repeatedly have their medicine taken away by the D.E.A? 

At what point can we look at this failed war on drugs and start some sort of reform to save money and cut down on the increasing prison population?

I'd love to hear your opinion on this issue.
Thanks

Mr. Obama, do you have any opinions on the recent anti-fileshare bills that have been going through congress lately? 
(bills like SOPA)
hey 9gag, look who has the president.
Mr. President, what is your administration going to do regarding increasing demand of oil and dependency on foriegn countries for oil? Are you going to push forward the Shale Oil project which is supposed to produce 6 million barrels per day by 2030?
This AMA would be a lot more interesting if I was American.
How can you justify the illegality of Marijuana when cigarettes and alcohol are legal and far worse for your health?

I apologize for asking you this question because I know you get asked this all the time but it's something of importance to me. This harmless plant has completely changed my life over the last year for the better. 

Why can't I use it in the confines and the comfort of my own home when it isn't even bothering anyone? Especially when I have co workers who are able to go home and drink themselves completely belligerent and sit and watch the crap that they dish out on TV?

There is clear evidence that there is benefit to it's usage and it just simply needs to be regulated like most things. There's also just a ton of general misinformation regarding it again like with most things.
Tonight at dinner:
Michelle: So, how did the AMA thing go?
Barack: Pretty good. One gentleman had some good insights on how to help avoid long-term deflation.
Michelle: Maybe you can reference him in one of your upcoming speeches? What was his name?
Barack: "Nuclear Cumshot"
Er mer gerd, Erbermerrrr. That is all...

10 questions answered. TEN. I am dissappoint Mr. President, I am dissappoint.
Why did you make promises of a "Paycheck Fairness Act", when in 2009, The U.S. Department of Labor already established that paychecks are fair?

A report you commissioned!

http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf

>this study leads to the unambiguous 
conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a 
multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify 
corrective action.  Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be 
almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers. 

-The U.S Department of Labor
Im going to vote for you :D i did last time

Is anyone else a little bit disappointed that he only answered 10 questions, and avoided all of the controversial ones entirely _

Mr. President you probably won't see this but if you do, I want to know that you saved my house, and I cannot thank you enough. My family owns a small business like the ones you fight for. Times have been rough, but my mom was able to refinance that mortgage for a much lower monthly payment because of you and ultimately it saved her marriage, the business, our house, and my life. THANK YOU. I'd vote for you if I was old enough! Keep Doing what you're doing. Also you look like a really fun guy in all your pictures.
Mr.President, I speak on behalf of Reddit when I ask this.
What is your favorite Pokemon?
the upvotes and downvotes are pretty representative of what this election is going to look like. Go Obama! You have my vote!
I missed it and that sucks. I don't agree with the man politically but I appreciate his effort in trying to do what's best for the country (even if I believe some of it isn't the best course of action). Mr. President, if you happen to be checking in to see other comments then I say thank you for at least caring enough to try to make things better for us all, it's more than most do these days.
I wish it was you. But alas I have an inkling of a feeling it is PR behind this bloody mess.
I saw you speaking at Iowa State University yesterday. *waves*
Mr. President, how long am I supposed to leave my popcorn in the microwave?
Holy...

Well I missed it, but this was epic.
What a shame that it's already over.  I'd like to know how it feels to know that a poor Canadian girl's lunch break redditing was *destroyed* when reddit died, and I didn't even know why!  The tragedy.

Also:

> NOT BAD!

Holy shit it's true, the US govt IS watching us online!  Scuse me while I go get my tinfoil mouse.
Mr. President,
Thank you for taking the time out of your busy life to speak with the people. I think this is amazing. I wish I had gotten to talk to you directly--that would of been exciting! Regardless of what anyone says, you probably have the most stressful job in our country. You can't please everyone, so congratulations and thank you!
I will enjoy your departure in Janaury. Feel free to take MO with you.

The Hope and Change was nothing but a sucker punch.
I'm wondering if your going to be answering more questions, because I and many other redditors have plenty. 
Also, what do you think of the legitimate rape law?
Mr. President, How do you feel about the goals of The Indians and The Chinese in sending astronauts  to the moon before 2020 for mining purposes?

Do you think The US should worry about staking a claim before the choice real estate up there is gone?
I appreciate you using "AMA". Well done sir.
I'm wondering why POTUS doing an AMA is receiving downvotes...
I'm currently living in Japan and my morning ritual is to check reddit on my phone. I saw the President made an AMA and I thought I was still dreaming! Thank you, Mr. President! You just became more awesome in my book. :)

I'm a little disappointed that you didn't answer that many questions. But I'm sure you're busy enough as is.

This reminded me to send out my absentee ballot. Thank you again, Mr. President!
Anyone else think that Obama looks like Gus from Breaking Bad?
My god... this is the biggest thread I've ever seen...
How many babies have you kissed in your political career?
Great AMA, it is historic.
You are the coolest president ever for doing this.
NOT BAD...that killed me.
Ways to save the US.

1. Legalize drugs. Prohibition created more crime, this is the same with the current war on drugs. If youve ever been to south america, drugs are very cheap to come by, this is why drugs are funneled into countries like the US because a higher profit margin is expected. In this way, the war on drugs is creating more disparity in the world by funding these drug cartels. No profit, means they cannot sustain their forces, which means that drug cartels will vanish. Have you ever seen a Liquor Cartel? Nope, because liquor is sold freely.

2. Ban private prisons. These prisons are run for profit and in order to keep these profits up, it is in their best interest to lock up the population. This ties in with the legalize drugs issue, since most of the people locked up are for non-violent victimless drug offences. Heck, most people are locked up for just victimless crimes. Prisons should be reserved for people with actual crimes concerning real victims, fines for the rest. Public prisons are enough for these people. The US has a shocking amount of its population in prison, for the land of the free, this is extremely shameful.

3. Cut military spending. This money is better served pumping back into the economy in improving the infrastructure throughout the US. Improving the education, training programs, etc. Who needs an army that can conquer the world, if they have to return to the rubble that was the US.

4. Get rid of the DHS, TSA, and all laws against the constitution. A free nation values privacy most of all. To be free is to be left alone if one wishes to be left alone. These agencies just cause more fear and intrude in peoples life, taking away our liberties as they see fit. A person that gives up their liberties for a small sense of security, deserves neither liberty or security.
Holy crap, this AMA **had** 14,779 cumulative upvotes about 3 hours ago. Now after refresh, that score has dropped vastly to 5,824 cumulative upvotes. Where are all the downvotes coming from, Obama-haters and Republicans?
what kind of circlejerk is this?
Ninjas or Pirates?
Mr.Obama, when you first got into office. I did not like you.
I was a bigot. A conservative beyond all reasoning. I had nothing politically correct about anything I said.

Today, I can truly say I am changed.
Although, I am still not in favor of you, I would like to know what you think of my idol, Ron Paul. For your reply, would make you stronger with independents, such as myself.
Looks like the Republican downvote brigade has been deployed. I looked at this AMA about an hour ago and it had over nine thousand upvotes.
Your the best president America ever had.

The fact that 1/2 the people of America can be tricked into not seeing that, really frightens me.
Heads up, if you use the gottaregister.com link in VA, it keeps rejecting valid driver's license numbers or the last four digits of the social security #. Just enter your entire social security # (no dashes) and it works.
Already got my vote :)
This is getting down voted fast, looked at it a few hours ago and it was about 15,000 karma, it has now dropped 10,000, what is this?
Why would anyone downvote a president answering questions on reddit regardless of their party?? That is just stupid.
I just want to be able to tell my grandkids I commented on this.
Where was I for this!?!?!?!?!? The one time I'm not on reddit......
I'm typing this only because it is the closest thing I ever get to emailing an American President.  By the way as an Educator, thank you for you.
Please stop trying to censor the internet. What good does it do anyone?
Why are you taking the hardest stance in American history against government [whistle blowers](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/us/politics/12leak.html?pagewanted=1&hp)
Why are you pushing harder for warrantless wire taps (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/04/obama-doj-worse-than-bush) than Bush did.
Mr. President.
I was a very strong supporter of you during the 2008 election, as well as my parents. Now, coming into the 2012 election, I have doubts about you, especially considering my own circumstances where I feel that you have done nothing for the common person like myself. What are you going to do for the struggling middle class, and more importantly, why should I continue to favor a man that has had such little impact on my life in almost 4 years now?
(Simple questions just because it's short and to the point.)
Why would you sign the NDAA? It's a bigger attack on freedom in this country than the Patriot Act (also why extend that too)?
I'm a young voter, my first general election. 
Been 1st looking for a job since you took office, I have only gotten 2 interviews out of 400+ applications.
I have no job, never been unemployed, just have never had a job.
I don't have any job experience to get a job, only volunteer experience.
Give me 5 good reasons why you deserve my vote.

EDIT: I'm also against government spending, so no 'programs' that will help me.
Well I think it's really cool that the president of the U.S. did an AMA... however I must say I was disappointed with this one - lots of the good questions weren't really answered :(
why does this feel more like a staffer answering questions than Obama?  video responses to questions would've been more authentic...this just feels like pandering to the tech crowd, like something Harper Reed would do.
Hello Mr. President! I wish I was able to vote for you, because I would if I could..... but I live in Canada so I can't vote in the US elections :P but I think you rock! All the best from Canada!!
I hope that one day soon, Canada boots Harper and elects someone as great as yourself!
JUST BY CHANCE.. you read one more!! lol.. Mr. President I want to know WHY marijuana is not legalized for mental disorders? My husband is bipolar and I watch him take all these medications that were made by chemicals in a lab! NOT SAFE.. do your research or talk to us because we have done the research. I would much rather see him smoke marijuana then to watch him pop all those pills. Which is safer God made marijuana that grows from the earth or Xanax, Klonopin, Valum etc.. made by man? Who knows maybe that is the reason marijuana was created was a calming herb. Really think about it people sure were more  happy in the 60's and all about peace so look at the world now. Do the right thing at least do a study and see. I don't care if people say marijuana is addictive really what about the other pill poppin meds? WHY  not marijuana WHY??
Can't wait till 50 years when we can brag to our grandkids that we met a president on the internet.
President Obama: why won't you unseal the documents referring to Fast & Furious.

Please consider doing so to be able to give even some remote justice for the deaths of over 300 mexicans and americans you are responsible for.
Mr. President, it is an honor to have you on our humble website. I just want to say I really hope you get re-elected and I will be voting for you.
Wait...people downvoted this?!?!
Mr. President,
    I just want to thank you for being a great President. I feel you strongly represent the American middle and working class. I attempt to talk to my friends and family why you represent us so well and how Republicans pose a real danger to social mobility as well as our position as the Global super power.
But mostly thank you is what I wanted to say. 
Lou
This is so late to the post, but seeing as I can't vote for Obama and am Australian, he can have an upvote.
The president of USA on reddit. Now I've seen everything.. and you've got my vote!
Do you think its weird how you earned the Nobel Peace Prize but then sent  military troops to Afghanistan?
Just pointing out that Obama received more upvotes here than he did votes in Wyoming, Alaska, and North Dakota, and more total votes here than he received in South Dakota, Montana, and Idaho, and just 3,000 less than West Virginia as of 12:20 eastern.
Redditors really did ask some great questions here.  Of course, the teleprompter-in-chief ignored them all and just replied to the softballs.

Barack, you're ostensibly a constitutional law professor.  You know that the PATRIOT act extension, the NDAA, and many other statutes you've signed are violations of the first, fourth, fifth and tenth amendments, and you've signed them anyway.  

You also know full well that ordering someone killed without so much as a warrant, let alone an indictment, a letter of marque or a declaration of war, is a criminal act for which you would be impeached, tried and imprisoned for life if this country ever regains a functioning justice system.  

Finally, you know also that it took a constitutional amendment to create the first federal ban on a drug, and that amendment has been repealed, leaving no remaining constitutional authority for the DEA's very existence, let alone their usurpation of the rights the voters of states like California and Oregon to explicitly permit the use of medical marijuana.  

My question, which I'm sure you'll never even attempt to answer, is this: given all of the above, coupled with your obvious incompetence in all matters pertaining to economics, why in the world should anyone ever trust you again?
Mr. President,
the indefinite detention of Americans without due process why?
Mr. President, I have a proposition for you. 

I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh. I live in the dorm of Sutherland West, Floor 6. 

There is a student on our floor by the name of Phillip, aka Raindrop. He is a confirmed Communist [trust me], and he is plotting to destroy the foundations of democracy as we know it. He literally told me "I hate freedom" and vowed to enslave the United States, Canada, Brazil, and surrounding areas. Please address immediately. 

<3
Dear Mr. President,

Thank-you for delivering us from the direction of the prior administration!

I am voting for you in November based on your excellent work of the
past four years.

Some suggestions:

 + divert at least 25% of military funding to, instead, educating
    our children in a school-voucher system such as Milton Friedman
    described and pay to attract top-teachers to the younger grades
    and let schools which normal parents don't like to end due to lack
    of attendance.

  + convert a 100x100 mile swath of the American southwest 
     military reservation to a 10,000 square mile photovoltaic/solar-
     concentrator farm and feed the resulting energy to the country

  + upgrade the national energy grid to handle higher loads more
     safely and with less power-loss

  + mandate the end of gas vehicles and their replacement with
     electric and electric-hybrids within 25 years

  + ensure that no one closer than a 2nd cousin can hold the same
     office, appointed or elected, at the national/federal, state, county
     and local offices (executive, judicial, congressional) within a 20
     year period

  + create large water-desalination at the coasts to create fresh water
     to deal with global warming. begin the process to protect the coasts
     from the water rise over the next decades

  + deal with illegal immigration and eliminate the anchor baby laws

  + encourage planned parenthood and available contraception

  + establish a moon-base and ensure Mars is then settled and
     terra-formed to ensure that when our sun goes red giant (and
     long before) we can have a place to live before generation starships
     take us further

   + ensure infrastructure is rebuilt like FDR's New Deal (roads,
      bridges, depressed cities and counties) - do this with massive
      tax breaks

   + tax the rich making more than $500,000 per year *heavily*
      give the proceeds to needy causes and mainly pay down the 
      national debt

   + balance the budget

   + continue closing bases and pulling back troops from overseas
      and re-educate them in ways to make products, provide services
      and prevent "occupation as a profession"

   + rebuild our manufacturing base and penalize executives who
      offshore and outsource. give large tax breaks to social companies
      that hire local workers

   + reform tort by ensuring that false lawsuits have quadruple or
      (or worse) costs of the unnecessarily sued to be paid by the suer

   + consider having the Federal Reserve have the constituent major
      banks pull in money and reduce the amount in circulation and 
      establish the U.S. back on the gold standard to control spending

   + let only people with merit from overseas become immigrants
      to our shores. We want the best of the best and not a free handout
      to all who come looking
   
And last, I advocate this kind of thinking for our American future in
all areas in which the government can influence and direct wisely:

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuW4oGKzVKc
who the hell would downvote this AMA!? WTF
Mr. president, being a user of marijuana and knowing its benefits why havent you rescheduled marijuana so that it can be prescribed to patients nationwide and also why havent you allowed farmers to grow hemp seeing that it is the #1 resource for almost all products industrial, medical, textile etc. The United States being the only industrious nation that doesnt grow Hemp really makes me wonder why you wont allow it to be grown.
***AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER***
I can't believe the name "PresidentObama" wasn't already taken by some smartass
adapting some of RON PAUL views might make you win again by a land slide... just an opinion, the war in iran will be the needle that broke the camel's back and that U.N. gun bill is UNCONSTITUTIONAL!!! the recent events that has been going on with gun violence the people are hip to the HEGELIAN PRINCIPLE or ORDER OUT OF CHAOS tactics what is happening people are starting to see you in the light of OBJECTIVITY instead of PRODUCTIVITY  good luck!!!
Surprised a few hours ago he had over 6000+ up votes now it's hovering at 3900... what happened?
Dear Mr. Obama
I'm Iranian
we love you
Wow this got downvoted into oblivian. Why?
Love you!
Hello Mr. President. I am a Republican but I still respect your place as president. How are you planning on beating Mitt? He seems to have a lot of experience.

Thanks a lot from France.
Why is marijuana still illegal and whats the deal with the war on coal?
Well, being in the UK, i'm majorly late to this. Still, fantastic to see Reddit being used in such a way. Awesome stuff. Keep up the good work.
Sir,

As predicted by reddit you will win the national election by approx. 4000 votes.
Was really hoping verification to be a mirror shot with him holding a card that read his name xD

Barack is a bro xD a president who I can at least relate to as being a guy who worked his way up.
Even though this is long since over and he will never see my comment:

Thank you Mr. President for taking the time to answer a few of our questions. It really means a lot, at least to me, seeing the most influential man on the Earth sitting down and giving us your time. Thank you so much and best of luck with your campaign.

[](/rdsalute "It has been an honor, sir")
Thanks for doing this Mr. President!
213,259 up votes, 209,714 down votes. Controversial much?
I'm very impressed that he took time to have a little chit chat with the redditors.
mr. president If you lose the presidential election. Will you run in years to come
Big respect to Obama for doing this AMA. Hello from Canada!

Who would downvote this?
When are you going to resign?
My name is Kul Acharya. I am refugee from Nepal. I have been here in U. S for 4 years. I just wanted to say, I am really proud to be in world's greatest country. Thank you America.
Big fan Mr. President, just wanted to say hi and I think you're awesome, hope you can reply to this!
Mr. President, do you feel that the American education system is acceptable where it stands considering the statistics globally?
well this AMA made me decide that i will be voting for you this election Mr. president.
and all i have to say is check out r/trees and tell me why thats still illegal.
I honestly don't understand how people can down vote the President of the United States of America for coming to Reddit, to our website. Even if you don't agree with his actions or policies, holy shit, the most important man on Earth gave up some of his time to answer whatever questions were thrown at him. Give the man some Creddit Reddit.
Wish I had as much comment karma as Barack Obama...
Mr. President, I happen to believe that the war in the middle east is my generation's equivalent of the war in Vietnam. It appears to be, for the most part, a senseless venture to impose ourselves in countries that we are not wanted in. It sucks away precious tax dollars that could be used for more appropriate ventures in our country, such as more affordable healthcare. I can't afford to get a very painful tooth pulled because fixing it would cost more than I can spare (some 500 dollars) even with my insurance, and financing seems not to be an option.

Worse than that, I feel that the difference here, as oppose the the war in Wietnam, is that the American public is too crippled by our vast liesures (i.e. internet, video games, digital television) to really be motivated enough to actively protest the war on a great enough scale that your administration would have no choice but to pull out immediately, as happened in the seventies. 

So I ask you, is being in the middle east REALLY something that benefits us as a whole?

Know that I am not criticizing you, I plan to vote for you in this coming election, but I ask you this because as opposed to former President Bush, I feel that you do have a good head on your shoulders and that you DO have good sense enough in you, not only as a leader, but also as an American man, to know that sending troops out just for the sake of giving them something to do and profiting from it does more harm than good. 

But isn't the fight HERE more important? Taxes are nuts, healthcare is a joke, corporations such as Apple are SUING other companies over supposed copyright infringement of a tablet's basic DESIGN, (I mean, what the hell else would samsung's tablet look like, a sphere?) 

Things are going to pot here so much that we are suffering over petty details instead of FLOURISHING from real progression.

Can you please help us, sir? I know you're the man to do this!!!
CHOOM 2012
>By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD!

I see what you did there...
Now I can tell my kids I up voted President Obama!
It is closed. He did it for only half an hour starting at 4:30, yesterday.
You don't even attempt to gain common ground with conservatives.  Why is that?
[I dont know where my other post went,so Im going to make another 1]

Dear Mr. President,
I believe that you are aware with the money problem in education in California. In California, now we are getting up to 40+ students in almost every period in middle school(I'm a middle schooler)and my teachers cant afford really great stuff for us. Like, we are using textbooks from 12 years ago, and I really think up to date textbooks will help us in the long run in school. Also,most of us students have to supply ourselves(Its not much big of a worry)but our teachers are paying for supplies such as pencils right out of there pockets. I think its really stressful for the teachers because they worry a lot about us students, and they cant provide for us without money from the school. I also really think they should apply to higher level students such as high schools, because there about 3-5 middle schools in our district,and there's only 1-3 high schools in the district. And like what a regular kid would say,"Make Summer Break longer!". I would say keep it the way it is. In my district,theres only 175 days of school due to budget cuts.(My school district is HUSD,and this should apply to other districts around California).

Im not saying all the education in California should be provided with money(Because Im well aware of California,not the other 49 states.) 

                                              Thank you for the consideration,
                                                             Derek riley,7th grade
Good thing he left before visiting spacedicks.
The Republicans have gotten a lot of good "*touchy-feely*" stories re Mitt which have been revealed during this last day of their convention. His good deeds as a Mormon volunteer have been made known. But these deeds are no better than your efforts as a community worker/leader.
At the convention there was some music. Not bad, but you have done better. You can do that again.
We'd better have some of our own good stories by known supporters (unknown ones too!) We need more popular actors than Clint Eastwood. We need more and younger (and, OK,  older) film performers.....and producers and directors and more diverse Hollywood people. We need more representation by respected news media. We need waaay BETTER music, better musicians We need specifics on where we will go into the future and **HOW**. Mitt's supporters have not mentioned "how."
You are in the position to have the last "say."
Give it your best. "Hit me with your **best shot**," then "**Fire Away**"
You've got a huge job ahead of you during the next 4 years. You need to emphasize how it was the very same party that are now opposing you, who have been preventing your policies (in congress) from being passed. In 2008 you were dealt a 51 card deck. You have done such a superb job so far. Let us keep the ball rolling for another term.
p.s. Why does Mitt Romney get to deduct such a large amount on his tax return on line 17 on his 2010 tax return??? If a person is not actively participating in a business then he/she is not allowed to deduct losses on his/her tax return. Why then did Mitt Romney get to deduct a loss on that line
Mitt Romney claims he was not "actively" participating in Bain Capital. If (in 2010) Mitt was not an active participant then why did he get to deduct over $200K in losses on that line???
Please encourage your constituents to **not**, "boo" during the convention. Let us present ourselves as a more refined, informed, caring constituent. 
Thank you for listening. Good luck in November. You have *my* single vote. Hope others will follow.
Mr. President, I appreciate your time and effort in answering this question, as it is a pressing issue for many of us here.  Young Professionals increasingly feel like they are getting stuck with someone else's bill, and it is good to know there are people in power looking for ways to address our concerns.

Unfortunately, I continue to have concerns after reading your reply.  You state correctly (in my opinion) that the future of our economy depends on the creation of middle class jobs.  But few Americans really consider assembly-lines or highway construction appropriate goals for college educated professionals.  

Investments in Science are wonderful in themselves, but apart from the development of some unforeseen technology on par with the microchip or Internet, requiring highly educated minds in its manufacture and proliferation, they do very little to create valuable jobs for a substantial number of people.  Similarly, investments in alternative energy are valuable in themselves, but do little to create jobs on a large scale beyond assembly line manufacturing that could likely be done more efficiently overseas.

In short, while I sincerely appreciate your efforts in addressing the plight of a shrinking middle class, I feel that your current ideas do little to fix the problem, and may in fact exacerbate it by replacing middle-class jobs with lower-class ones.  Instead, I suggest that we research the most promising and productive areas of middle class growth, build a plan that encourages growth in these areas, and make efforts to ease and encourage movement into these industries.  In recent history the advancement of world-connecting technologies and their ability to improve an increasingly broad swath of industries has shown promise, for example.  Meanwhile, addressing the cost of education (or, more importantly here, re-education) could make for a more fluid workforce, and efforts to relieve the burden of medical and housing debts should reduce many Americans' misgivings about change.

In truth, we are in a recession created primarily by those most affected by it, and the majority of the power to relieve it lies in the collective hands of those suffering.  We cannot expect to return to the relative luxury our parents enjoyed without first making sacrifices and developing a more mature outlook on personal finances as a whole.  As a result, there's little that the government can really do.  I worry that we have exhausted the limits of what financial interjections and economic theory can do.  Rather, this time the people will have to climb out on their own by way of the spirit of hard work and ingenuity that propelled America to its position of world leadership in the past.  However, you do have the power to encourage these attitudes through incentive and information, and I pray that you to do so for the sake of your country and its people.
Wait...Obama is a redditor? America is doomed.
President Obama and family, your rise to leader of our Nation brought tears of joy to my eyes and hope back to my heart.  I was really frightened for my children and future generations.  Hopefully we get more caring and loving leaders like yourself in office in the future.  Your example is hopefully teaching the world the power of concern for our fellow man. I know it would take a lifetime to fix all the problems that in my view stem from greed.  But that leads to my question;
   Are you and your closest Associates  keeping an eye out for a successor with similar values, specially capable of dealing with  humanitarian , scientific and  ecological issues?  The work towards preserving Earths climate and stopping pollution seem underrated politically, but your first term has fought hard battles to begin the long process of waking everyone up and keeping corporate superpowers   from further polluting our oceans and air.  From what I have read and researched, we, here on planet earth are in big trouble if we don't convert to clean energy very soon. In my life time I think terrible things will begin happening.  It would be a shame to allow another tycoon into the white house after so much hard work for the sake of humanity.  And I don't see the terraforming and colonization of  Mars happening in time to save us from ourselves. 
  So are you thinking about supporting someone to continue where you leave off?
  Who might that be? (If you are allowed to suggest options)
  Or is the topic of "Climate change" and "global pollution"  still too threatening for  political campaigns? 
  And do you fear for the generations to come regarding the possible impact of massive global , environmental change?  It would only take a few years of drought in key locations to disrupt the food availability even here in America, coupled with population increases, the oil industries unwillingness to concede and/or adapt new energy sources which won't be as profitable at first  = scary as hell to me.  What about you?
  Sincerely Dan A. S.
Here is an awesome question, How the hell was President Obama an available username?
cant believe I missed this... so very disappointed.
Guys, this AMA ended weeks ago. No more questions.
Hello, late comment, just passing through.
Congratulations, Mr. President.
How do you feel about Bush leaving all the trash for you to clean up?
How big are the q-tips at the White House? Also, chimpanzee or baboon? How has socialism impacted your life? I know it's making mine terrible thanks to your liberal actions.
Hey, am i really talking to President Barack Obama?
Want to get a comment in enforce it's archived so I can be part of this awesomeness
[deleted]
I know I am late but thanks.
Why is The Wire your favorite show and what if anything can we learn from that show that can help us to create a better America?
How are you doing?
I'll try to keep this brief. 

I am one of the farthest right people I know. I oppose virtually everything you stand for. I support Romney for this election. I've volunteered at my local Rupublican office. I have a blog and a twitter that are for promoting conservative values. I'm subscribed to www.reddit.com/r/republican, and r/conservative. Even r/teaparty. I post to Facebook about current political issues and I keep my friends informed (with my bias added of course). 

But right now, that does not matter. I wanted to say thank you for reaching out to the people, and taking questions from us. I wanted to say that you have one of the most eloquent speaking abilities I have ever seen (even if a few blunders are mocked for months by us on the other side). All this is to say one thing, really. I do not care about party lines. I see myself and you, mr president, as Americans. We share the belief that America is a great nation, and both have a desire to see it prosperous and in a much better state than it is now. We may define "better" differently, and may prefer different methods to get there, but I do not say that you are bad for disagreeing with me. I only say that we are different. 

So, may we unite in the three things we share- being American, believing in Jesus Christ as Lord, and now, being redditors. God bless you as you lead this nation.
Mr President: How do you deal with all the crazy?
What do you think is the biggest deciding factor/issue for this year's presidential election? By the way, it's awesome that you're doing this!
I'm under 55, and I'm very worried the GOP is going to end public Medicare. After you win reelection, what will you do to make it more financially sound so that they can't come back in 4 years, 8 years, n years and claim it's about to go bankrupt and needs to be changed?
Hello Mr. President!

What are the three (for sake of putting a number to it) decisions that you made in your life that you believe directly led you to where you are now? 

Did you even ever dream of becoming the President while you were young?
Is it hard having so many people believe so many completely false things about you? And if you could get those people to understand one thing about you, what would it be?
Will you give me an internet fist bump back?

*fist bump*
We are not voters, but as a Canadian is there a good reason we can believe in your campaign over the GOP?
As a member of the United States Army I would like to say that I fully support you in this upcoming election as I feel you have done a lot with the first term of your presidency.  My question is what is your plan for the military in your upcoming (hope) presidential term?  Thank you for doing an AMA.  I salute you commander in chief.
Do you like tacos?
I live in Canada, and after you're finished with your second term please come run for Prime Minister. 

I'm serious.
No one will ever read this
Oh lord, I know you wont see this but just tell me if Area 51 and aliens are real!!!!!!!!!!!!
as a european: please please please vote for Obama. Foratheism, for common sense, for the world!
We need Romney to be in office.....
The president is using an apple computer in his verification photo... I'll get the pitchforks.
wait wait wait, something must be wrong here, I am Barack Obama!
Why do you want to impose your views of what is best for others using force? Don't you think it is wrong?
The real Barack ObAMA.
We're still waiting for that Change we can believe in.
I have some questions for you Obama, 1) why is everyone working under you billionaires with ties to, proven to be, corrupt institutions. 2) For what reason have none of the individuals responsible for the 2008 housing bubble been imprisoned. 3) Are you even remotely aware of how your country's Banking system functions, and that damage its doing to MINE!. 4) For what reason is your government inability to audit the Federal reserve. 5) For what reason is your government putting so much time and effort into surveillance over its own people. 6) your country just passed a bill allowing it to place Military personal in the streets of your city's, this doesn't seem even slightly wrong to you?.
I think I just peed myself a little.
My face when Barrack dodges all the marijuana questions.
Why is this getting so many downvotes???  This is a perfectly good IAMA!
What songs are on your iPod?
I know you aren't perfect. But this is the reason I'm voting for you.

Anyone who honestly thinks the president was actually giving the answers needs to get a reality check. You really think the president would answer with "NOT BAD!" to a question and put it in his opening remarks? This is obviously the works of some shitty intern who thought (s)he could get some points for being witty for having a minutia of meme knowledge.
Pretty sure this will get buried, but I'm gonna say this anyway.

**I am Canadian.**

As a Canadian, I'm often watching what goes on down south, and while Canada is by no means a bad place to live in, I'm jealous of you Americans.

All we have is a cunt of a Prime Minister. You guys have one of the best leaders the world has ever seen, and while nobody is perfect, Barack Obama included, I for one am jealous beyond belief. Dear Obama, you give me hope.

I always miss the best AMA's! >:(

I'm a big fan - I can't vote as I am not yet a Citizen.  I am originally from the UK and have been in the USA for a very long time.  I can't tell you how thankful I am you're doing something about healthcare here.  I am not used to paying for it and Americans need to know how it feels to NOT get nickel and dimed.  We all deserve to have affordable healthcare in this country.  And the insurance companies?  They are clearly a *for* profit industry.  So thank you.

Now if you can do something about a longer (partly paid-for) maternity leave for women...that would be appreciated :)  The standard here is awful and some companies don't give anything at all :(

I love that you're doing an AMA!
#cough# illuminati #cough#

Came here to say i am going to vote for this man.
If you were to go back to teaching law school, having been the President, could you? What would you do differently?
You're widely believed to be someone who believes in cooperation and consensus in terms of governing. The GOP are not. When will you and the democrats start playing hardball and stand up more forcefully to Republican belligerence?
Mr. President. Thanks for dropping by. What concrete steps is the US Government taking to achieve an AIDS-free generation? When will we see a USG strategy with concrete steps for reaching this goal?

Hey Mr. President! Bummed I missed the AMA... Anyway just want to send my support and wish you luck this November. Obama 2012!!!
Now its only a matter of time before Romney does one...
Wow, he really didn't answer any controversial questions. What a talented politician! We need more like this guy.
And my wife wonders why I check reddit so often. Look what happens when I don't.

 Love you Mr. President, I wish you the best.
why so many downvotes?
This is a GIANT pathetic joke! What was achieved during this 30 minute AMA? The answered questions regard nothing that has already happened. Just another platform for advertising for the next election.
Dear Mr. President,

I am sure you are probably not going to read this comment, but I just wanted to tell you that despite the negative remarks, I believe in your commitment to changing this country.  I feel that change is a necessity.  I think people are too quick to judge change when it fails.  There are many people who are very conservative and feel that their religious or own personal truths are the best for all.  I feel that you try to look at each problem from every perspective, and I appreciate that whole heartedly.  

There are many people, young and old, that say you have failed us.  Honestly, I dont see it.  Despite some set backs, I feel that your administration has done more with less.

First off, I would like to thank you for having an open heart and accepting equality for all.  In this day of age, I dont understand why two people, regardless of sex, cant marry each other and receive the same benefits as hetero couples.  The fact that this country has internal fights with itself over this basic issue lowers my expectations for this countrys future.  

Lately, the topic regarding abortions seems to be resurfacing.  Personally, I dont understand why politicians (most being men) have any right to dictate what I do with my body.  I feel that the government would be better off if it concentrated on important issues and stop trying to control what I do with my own body.

I feel that the People are no longer taking responsibility for their own actions and are just blaming their problems on your Presidency.  The steps that you are taking to get this country where it needs to be are in my opinion, a positive direction.  Notice how I said positive and not right; no one knows what the right answer is to solving our problems.  But I believe that you are definitely taking us to a better place.  

I am a woman and not voting, in my eyes, is an insult to all those women and men who fought for my right to vote.  President Obama, you can count on my vote!
all pretty tame questions and answers, the president didnt say anything that he wouldnt have said on a podium...not satisfied
Why has this been downvoted so much?
[deleted]
I think it's awesome you said "NOT BAD" in your original post! I can just imagine your face like in the widely popular meme image :D Thank you for being our President is all I really have to say, it was a great 4 years and may the best man win the next 4!
Who the fuck downvotes the president? I mean come on.
As a Canadian, I wish I was American just to vote for this guy.
This is a terrible example of the"internet empowering conversations that strengthen our democracy"... You've only answered safe easy questions and your answers are nothing more than pre-planned generic party talking points.  There's no more meaningful interaction happening in this thread than there is in those "we the people" petitions your administration loves to ignore.
He said not bad. The president just leveled up to level 86.
Y U NO ANSWER WEED QUESTIONS?!
How upset are you that people demanded you show your birth certificate when Mit Romney doesn't have to reveal his past tax returns!?

Mr. President, can you please help reframe the discussion about Roe v. Wade to being about "Right to Privacy?" not just "right to choose"?
Would you agree that income should not determine the quality of a person's healthcare?
Would you consider creating "small business centers" that instruct and assist individuals in launching their small business from scratch? These would be located in many populous areas such as DMVs or post offices.

There are tons of individuals running "off the books" non-taxed businesses for many reasons. I believe many simply are intimidated by the entire process and avoid it all together.
Mr. Obama, The previous administration has done a number of things to stun the advancement of stem cell research.  Once you are elected into your second term, how do you plan to foster its growth?
What do you think about the Eurocrisis and what about sovereign debt in the US? Is there the same risk and shouldn't be the debt reduced, payed by the rich?
If reelected, how will you change or adapt to working with the new Congress? It is in such a dysfunctional place.
Pancakes or waffles?
You are the first president I ever voted for, and I was very proud and excited to do so. Now I feel like most of your decisions are influenced by your corporate sponsors. If I vote for you again this year, everyone knowing that if you win it is your last term (meaning you have no one to please but us citizens), can you PLEASE do something to end the corporate stranglehold on America?

I understand how the system works in the US, and I hate it. I just really thought you were different.

Mr. President,

As a military veteran, I receive the Post 9/11 GI Bill. I don't receive BAH while I'm not in school, even though it's not my fault (Christmas break, etc).  I know the rules changed last October, is there anyway that we can be grandfathered in if we were enrolled prior to October 2011? 

Can't wait to vote for you in the upcoming election. Good luck in the debates, I'm sure you'll tear Rmoney a new one.

I'm sure this is a typical question, but what is it like being the first black president? And I personally think you're doing a great job with your presidency, please beat Mitt Romney!
How difficult is it to have to balance making the right decision (in your mind at the time) versus making the public happy?  Do you think that will change if you are re-elected for a 2nd term?
Are you actually the president or is this just someone working for you to answer questions? Surly you can't answer EVERYONE'S questions as just one person.
There seems to be a lot of misinformation and flat out lies that are presented by candidates, politicians, and journalists. It seems to be a growing issue. 

Is there a way to curb this new behavior of "my ignorance is just as good as your intelligence" without limiting free speech?
Hello Mr. President, what's your favorite thing and most unprofessional thing that you do in the White House?
Why don't you stand up to the Republicans in congress instead of giving them everything they ask for, and why don't you fight back more against their lies & distortions?
Mr. Obama, first off, you're the man. Onto the question.

Mr. Obama, can you give us some insight into what, if any, domestic infrastructural projects you might try to implement during your next 4 years?  I'm talking about roads, bridges, electricity, fiber optics, etc.
Whats your favorite cereal in the morning?
Mr. President, thank you for answering some questions for us. What has been the hardest and unforeseen difficulty you have encountered since you've become president? Also, where do you think our country needs to improve the most?
Who wins the NBA title this year?
What would a normal day, with no presidential duties to adhere to, consist of for you, President Obama?
Dear President Obama:

Do you use Gentoo?
What are some of the effects you think the negative press has, not on the public, but yourself? What do you think when you see misrepresented facts and blatant lies (the welfare ad) about you on TV? How does your family respond when they see an attack ad on you?
Oh wow, the President of the US, coming to Reddit?

I know at least by my clock it's not 4:30ET yet, so I'm going to go ahead and post my questions right now as I'd be heading out after I post this. Hopefully you'll have an answer for me.

This is awesome. I'd have to say it's an honor to meet you, at least online.

I know this might be a political hot potato, but what are your thoughts regarding ObamaCare?

When I heard that ObamaCare had passed, I was happy to know that we're moving one step closer to national healthcare for everyone.

However, I have to wonder if you yourself are frustrated with the two parties not really working with you in Congress regarding ObamaCare? It seems like as if most of Congress hates ObamaCare now that it's passed.

And  what would be the one thing you'd like to change, right now, at this very instant the moment you read this message? Let's say you had full knowledge of the consequences of making that choice right here, right now, and the effect of that is immediately obvious? (Note, this is a completely hypothetical question. Essentially, I want to know if there's something like that, that you want to have happen immediately.)

That said, I'd like to take a moment and say thank you for doing what you can for the country. It means a lot, despite the obstacles you've had standing in your way.

Honestly, I'll say this right now: I'm voting for you again. Your policies haven't even started to take effect. I'd like to see you stick around long enough to carry your policies through, and make those genuine changes.

Edit: And for what it's worth, I'm sorry to see that you have had to face so many obstacles for various reasons. It sucks to see such a great President be forced to break his promises to the country because of Congress's willingness to destroy the country. And that, I think... is the worst fear you have right now, as the President now that you've had a look at what goes on behind the scenes as the President.
Hi. Would you be willing to debate any third party candidates, such as Jill Stein?
Also, for a non-political question, do you like any punk rock bands?
The saying goes..."Don't let the turkeys get you down." What's your secret? You work with A LOT of turkeys, and yet you keep your cool, your intellect, and Michelle is always smiling!
How does the DOE plan to support virtual schools? Specifically where do you see online K-12 education fitting into NCLB legislation.
Not that I expect an answer, but this is more of an example of why the system is broken. I am a 32k+ a year, shared custody father of 2 boys. I make enough to pay my bills, and scrape by paycheck to paycheck. I have attempted getting assistance from the Fed, but the most I ever got was 24 dollars a month in food stamps. Work harder, save better, I guess. 
My question, if I make too much money to qualify as low income or get any assistance, why the heck do I get a tax return every year of 5000+ dollars? I'm paying roughly 4200 in per year, so I get all of that back, plus more, due to having children and custody for 51% or more of the time. If the defecit is such a concern, if tax dollars hard at work is such a go-to motto, why the hell aren't mine being used for something beneficial? I suppose I could send the check back every spring, but what's the point in the first place? Systems like this make me wonder how we've even gotten this far. Please, if you're going to take my money every payday, keep it and use it for bettering the country, rather than a short term interest free loan.
Can I have a job? I'm quite sure I'm qualified to be a speechwriter.
If you could use your presidential power to bring back one TV show, which one would it be?
Why do you continue to allow the DEA raids on dispensaries in multiple states?
Hello Mr.President, I must ask a few things: 

1. What did you think of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's portrayal of you on SNL?

2. What was your best memories from Columbia and Harvard?
Nice try Mitt Romney...
Why don't you REQUIRE employment search in exchange for providing funds to individuals, and impose a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families
Mr. President, the White House Honey Ale recipe is something homebrewers like myself would love to be able to have. We've sent a petition your way as well as a FOIA request for the recipe. I was wondering if you could expedite the process with an executive order for its release?
Hello Mr. President, 
First off I want to say thank you for doing your job.
Also, what has been your favorite moment thus far being president of the United States?
What is your exercise routine?
You had talked about labeling GMO's while you were running for president. Why aren't you on board with it now?
Mr President,

- Why does your campaign not respond more forcefully to the "We Built It" line used by the Romney camp? It is a clear misrepresentation of your words yet there has never really been a response or clarification of what you meant. I hope you or your campaign can address it as I do believe in responsible government spending in infrastructure and technology being of great help to Americans and essential to a strong economy.

- How do you feel about the problem of money in politics? I am concerned that after numerous pledges to only accept public financing that you went back on your word. I know many Americans are concerned about how much the wealthy corporations can influence elections. 

- If elected to a second term do you plan to address the failed war on drugs and seek to reform the way the government attempts to address the illegal drug issue? 

Thank you.
Hello Mr. President,

What are your thoughts on the Republican National Convention so far? Have you been watching?
Mr. President -

Can you and Congress do anything to increase the viability of third parties? Libertarians, Greens, Constitutioners, and other fringe parties always get buried vis-a-vis press coverage and fundraising because of our current system.
Mr. President, can you explain what you hope for Afghanistan after Coalition troops leave?
I always wanted to shake hands with the President, but I'd take a virtual shout out. Thanks for your hard work, you seem like a honest man.
Just wanted to say I'm a huge fan. My question is: how are you so cool? even the way you jog down stairs seems like the coolest thing in the world.
This year's election falls on my birthday. You'd better win or else I will be stuck with the worst birthday present ever for at least four years.
Why has your administration been harsher on medical marijuana users than any one before it?
How do you foresee the future of education under your administration during a potential second term?
It's pretty clear special interest is raping the American middle class through the political process.  Our net worth is steadily decreasing, health care costs are spiraling even for those of us who work hard and have insurance.

As someone who has always been employed and paid my taxes fairly and tried to do the right thing, I feel like a sucker.  I am sure I am not the only one feeling utter despair over this.

What real things are you going to do about it?
What do you worry about?
do you think john stewart of the daily show would make a good president? he seems to understand the real issues and has great insight, albeit sarcastic at times, on how to address / approach
Mr. President, 

Among other things, Republicans insist that climate change is nonexistant, tax cuts pay for themselves, rape victims don't get pregnant, the people in Iraq would be grateful for the US invading their country and that President Reagan NEVER raised taxes.

How do you aim to govern with an opposition that doesn't rely on facts?
Do you feel that Net Neutrality is something that would be possible to  achieve in the US?
What would you say is the greatest scientific achievement in human history? How about just American history? And what do you think will be the greatest scientific achievement of the next 4 years?
Hi Mr. President ! I have a simple question, do you play video games ? If yes, which kind ? Any title/series in particular ?
So I guess you have to change the sidebar now?
Barack, I'm about a mile north of your place in CoHi. I'd love to have you over for Pierogies and a beer. Hit me up!
Mod dudes. Sidebar says "Bararck Obama" in the Upcoming IAmAs section. Might want to fix that before, you know, The President sees it or he might start flipping tables. ( 
Mr. President, I first and foremost want to thank you for doing this.  It's nice to see a politician on the internet.

My Question: What do you make of the LIBOR rate scandals and how it went seemingly unmentioned in the national media?
If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?

Hello, Mr. President.  What is your favorite place to eat in Chicago?
Mr. President, what's antitrust enforcement going to look like if you get reelected?
Talk to us about the prospects of publicly funded elections and what efforts you might undertake to support election reform. What is your take on Citizens United and how much of a role do you think private funding should take in our electoral process?
Mr. President since you have come out saying you support marriage equality for same-sex couples, do you have any plans on legislature to end this discrimination or are you going to leave this up to the states?
Will you be taking steps to allow skilled international college students who studied in USA (from places like China and Singapore, and studying STEM disciplines) to more easily find work in the United States?
It seems lobbying is still a huge part of Washington. I voted for you in hopes that there would be some efforts to curb the influence of lobbying groups. If you get elected a second term would there be any efforts in this area?

Also high five from us homebrewers. Can we have your recipe ;-)
How familiar are you with internet memes?
Why do you continue to prosecute patients who need marijuana for their care?
Mr. President, as a huge supporter of yours, what should I tell my friends and family when they ask me specifically what you plan to do about the economy in the coming term specifically, I am actually a big fan of spending, what kind of new stimulus might we get to see in the coming 4 years.
Wow. Mr. President. Thanks for stopping by. Most of us are students and about to graduate and it is scary out there. What kind of country will we be looking at in the next 4 years? We are all realistic so don't sugar coat it.
How come people can be extradited from the UK to the US but not the other way around? No evidence is really needed too am I right?
If I were president, I'd wear a cape and a crown at my inauguration. 

Have you ever considered doing that?
Mr. President, with the success and popularity we have seen from the Curiosity rover, are you considering higher funding options for NASA?  At a time when we as a Nation are falling behind countries like China and India in areas like science and engineering, I would hope that we would seize the opportunity that the Curiosity has created for us.  I for one, would love my child to grow up to become an engineer; the rover gives us a vision of what could be.  For the children I think that is important; having something to strive towards.
Wow, Welcome Mr.President, all the way from Scotland, UK. You are an inspirational figure! P.S. avoid the  sub-reddits on here, just stick to this page and you will be fine!
I've heard that you're a reader, and while I understand this is an election year, what books are you currently reading? Or what was the last book you've read?
Mr. President, the imaginations of curious minds across the nation have recently been piqued once again by the landing of the Curiosity Rover on Mars. Unfortunately, it seems as if not a year goes by that NASA doesn't face further budget cuts. If reelected, could the renewed interest in space exploration and scientific discovery play a part in budget discussions as they pertain to the future of NASA? Thank you!
What responsibility or task did you not expect to have as the President of the States previous to entering office?
Why is DHS purchasing all that ammo?
If re-elected, what is your strategy to unite congress, and ensure both parties work together to do what is necessary to get the country back on it's feet economically?
Mr. President, what are your plans for higher education if you are re-elected! Thank you for doing this also!
Mr. President,

Thanks for doing this.  It means a lot.  Big fan.

What is your favorite season of The Wire?  Mine is Season 4.
Barack Obama, have you met Gabe Newell in person?  I heard hes a pretty cool guy.
I just want to point out that this is currently right behind a picture of a penis shaped canker sore. I love this website. Hi Mr. President.
There are some that would say that legalizing Marijuana and other street drugs would only worsen the problem, while others argue that it would only marginalize and work to control it much like alcohol.

Your thoughts on this, sir?
What do you think will be the most difficult challenge for the country over the next four years? Why?
Barack Obama, what's your favorite cologne?
Really?
You have announced support for gay marriage and human rights, but what is your first step in regards to policy for this topic?
How important are the world's perception of the US and it's citizens to you?  (ps. Canada loves you)
Oh my goodness. Reddit actually has the president of the United States doing an AMA?! One of the (if not THE) most powerful men on the planet. Unbelievable!

What does a person ask the President....?

Here goes... 

I am a Canadian, and as such I like to think our two countries have a fairly stable relationship. What, in your opinion, is something that Canada and the United States does well cooperatively?

In contrast to that, what is something you wish our two nations could improve upon together?

I would just like to thank you for giving the average citizen the chance to pick your brain. If I was American, you would have my vote.
Dear Obama, as a DC resident I would like to know what your opinion is on DC voting rights. This is a very important issue to me as me or my family don't have a senator to represent us.
If you're coming back to NC to campaign, will you visit UNC and play the basketball team again. Please? :-)
What are your thoughts on the Occupy movement? How do you feel about the fact that tens of thousands of Americans are upset and feel like their government does not adequately represent them?
Dear Mr President,
Four years ago you promised increased protections for whistleblowers, but instead your actions have been the opposite (e.g. Bradley Manning, grand jury Assange). 

* What made you promise increased protection for whistleblowers?  But then walk it back?

* Do you not believe your administration's actions have decreased transparency and curbed whistleblowers? Is this not damaging to the USA in the medium-term?
Is Barcelona or Madrid going to win the game today? Also, do you prefer Messi or Ronaldo?
Mr. President, what part of "a normal life" do you miss the most that you can't enjoy anymore due to who you are and what you do? The easy, little things that an average joe takes for granted. 

I'm always curious when someone gets into such a public position how their lives change and what about their "old" life that they miss. Thank you. :)
I'm in New Zealand, I can't vote for you but you should come visit. It's really quite pretty here and the food is great!
What's one thing you wish you could have done but couldn't, for whatever reason?
Why should you remain in office?
Mr. President, how do you hope to improve healthcare for Americans in the future. The current provisions being implemented - specifically on pre-existing conditions as a good example - seem like a great start, but where would you like to see healthcare improve in the future?
Hello Mr.President,

What would you consider to be you single greatest in office achievement?

Thank you!
Mr. President, which is more frustrating? Running against a campaign based on lies and twisted truths, or finding out that no republican or their blind followers are willing to listen when the facts are presented before them? How do you not spend all of your time 'trying to set the record straight'?
Do you have any plans on coming to Houston during the campaign? I know we're in Texas (and are pretty much locked for Romney) but we'd love to see you!
Once you're done being the President can you come up to Canada to be the Prime Minister? We **really** need your help.
Why does your administration think it can kill American citizens, either in the States or abroad, without trial?
Why haven't the people responsible for the economic crash been held accountable yet?

What do you perceive to be the biggest obstacle in tackling our enormous debt?
Where's that guy that asks about salad dressing!  Call him!
Given a new term by the people in November, how will you improve the dialogue with the Republican opposition in Congress, and are you willing to hold fellow Democratic representatives' feet to the fire when it comes to increasing revenues, make them understand that running the country comes before running for reelection?
When you were a kid, did you just tell yourself, "I want to be POTUS." Or was it a gradual realization?
When are we going to have the freedom to play online poker in the US?  I have friends that have had to relocate out of the country in order to play.   What is your administration doing(if anything) to help make this happen?
Why has government spending gone out of control?  How will we ever be a strong nation if we can't even pay the bills on time?
As a Canadian, I just want to say that I wish I could vote in the US. Of course, I would vote for you, President Obama. In fact, if you ran in Canada, you'd win by a landslide.
Just want to say thank you for doing a great job.

What is the hardest part about campaigning that people don't know?

If you get elected for a second term are there issues you will or want to handle differently?

How do you personally balance your decisions between what is politically the best choice and what you think is best for the country?
Hi Mr. Obama!

I'm not an American citizen, so my question has more to do with the global zeitgeist than current American politics:

Hope seems to be a scarce resource now, and it seems to me that one of the biggest problems (well, except for all the *real* ones) is that we, as a global population, don't really believe in a positive outcome of the situation we are in. How do you see us getting out of the current mental downturn and actually look forward to the future again?
Hello Mr. President. I ask the following question with all respect due to you. Myself, and many other Americans feel a complete lack of faith in our elected officials. What, if anything, will you do in your second term to help decrease the corruption that has saturated American politics as of late?
Are you a lion or a tiger?
Do you plan to address the racial coding in many of the messages coming from your Republican opponent?
Tell us something we probably don't know about you :)?
I would love to know what the plan is for helping out those of us struggling with unbelievable student debt - is anything in the works for us?  Or, similarly, will there ever be student loan reform?
While I understand you are against whistle blowers such as Bradley Manning and Julian Assange because of state and military secrets, do you think it's acceptable to keep stories such as what happened in the the 'collateral damage' video from surfacing?
Why didn't you publish any scholarly articles during your time teaching at the University of Chicago law school?
Is there a particular figure you look up to? Who inspires you the most, throughout any time of difficulty or serious thought?
In 2008, you promised to end federal drug raids on states that have approved the use of medical marijuana.

Why has your administration has continued and escalated these raids?
How do you plan on encouraging the growth of America's startup industries? Do you think the JOBS act is sufficient to guarantee long-term innovation? If not, what else needs to be done?

And how do you plan on getting more widespread and diverse enrollment in STEM programs in American schools?

If you could pick from anyone not in the line of succession to become president in January 2013, who would it be, other than yourself?
Can we be pen pals?
Mr. President, if you could pass one bill exactly how you wanted with bipartisan support what would you choose?
In you're second term, will you be more aggressive and actually work to fulfill your promises to move America forward? Or will you just continue to agree with the Republicans and pretend to be a progressive?
What is the best thing the average American can do to make a difference?
What are your views on the current state of Oil Companies around the world (high oil costs, crisis in Venezuela, etc) and the possibility of funding projects for other Energy Sources?
Mr. President, to whom do we owe a billion years of Reddit Gold for convincing you to do an AMA?
This is the Internet. "Click->Copy->Paste" is less a crime, more a way of life. Piracy isn't going away, and it's not going to get more difficult. I'm not going to fill this post with claims of an appropriate solution that everyone finds fair, but if this post is highly voted, then people disagree with our current system and find it unfair.

Will you, in a second term, try to reach a better social agreement on copyright, trademarks, piracy, (and to throw some business in the mix, a la Apple vs Samsung) patents?
Firstly, good luck in the upcoming election Mr. President. Secondly, I am wondering what kinds of things you'll be doing on 3 things:

1: Net neutrality and the freedom of the internet.

2: The right for gay couples to get married just like other couples.

3: The ever increasing national debt.

Thank you for you time.

Good Afternoon, Mr. President. What do you intend to do about corporate takeover of this country? Why haven't big banks been held accountable? why does the 1% crush us and you do so little? why did DHS take control of telecommunications? why has DHS ordered over a BILLION high powered ammunition?Why is there Mormon gulags in Utah?Respectfully, a 99%'er
Mr. President, thank you so much for coming and speaking with us "normal people". As a young person living in a non-swing state (NY) what can I do to help raise support for you in a meaningful way?
Mr. Obama, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?
How do you compete with people who not only unswayed by facts, but deliberately, pridefully ignorant, doubling down on their initial position when presented with overwhelming evidence to the contrary?

Sir,
Thank you so much for your stand on LGBT equality.  Over your first term, you have done a lot of good for a lot of people.  I hope that Americans are smart enough to realize it, and re-elect you.  

I wish you were running in my country, so that I could vote for you!
What is your favorite food?
Greetings from Ireland. Have you heard of/do you watch The Young Turks (online or on Current TV)? Do you agree with Wolf PAC's view that Citizens United should be repealed in order to diminish the influence of corporate money on election results?

Hi Mr. President, and thanks for doing this AMA. I don't think it's hyperbolic to say that student loan debt is crippling the younger generation of Americans, and the government response has been virtually nonexistent. If you win a second term, what concrete steps would you take to ease the burden on recent graduates?
Are you concerned about the many states that have passed Voter ID laws? Many people who have voted for years won't be able to vote this election because they don't have a drivers license.

And I don't mean politically. Are there countries you want to visit or things that you've always wanted to do but couldn't because you had to put them off on your path to being the president?
Mr. President, during your last campaign you pledged repeatedly to respect state medical marijuana laws. Your attorney general, Eric Holder, recently testified to Congress that the Justice Department targets only medical marijuana providers that are operating out of accordance with state law. How, then, do you explain your administration's actions against Harborside Health Center, Berkeley Patients Group, Vapor Room and so many others that have not broken any state laws?
President Obama, what's your opinion on the recently introduced effective 'poll tax' requiring photo identification (that costs upwards of $60) in several states?
Mr President, 
Do you believe that our energy policy should be viewed as a national security issue? If so why isn't clean energy positioned to the public in a way that energy independence will help cut funding to some enemies of the United States?
We all hear about the big political and social issue which both you and Governer Romney address, but politics aside, what is your biggest concern in respect to the future of the United States?

Also, whether it be in 5 months or (hopefully) 4 years, what do you plan on doing once you are no longer the president?
Mr. President, are you going to do anything differently if you get re-elected for a second term? And if so, what policies might you make a priority to improve or change? 

Thank you. 

Also, please tell Michelle to stop sending me fund raiser requests in the mail. I signed up to have dinner with you and I keep getting spam. Although it would still be cool to have dinner with the Obamas. (Hint hint.)
What is "area 51"?
A lot of cities are still behind the curve when it comes to technology and "government as a platform" because they don't have the existing staff to properly initiative open data and technology efforts. Some cities are hiring Chief Data Officers, do you have any plans to make positions like this more prevalent at all levels of government?
I am hoping you kick his butt in the election.

Mr. President, how do you balance your job duties with your parental duties?
What is your favorite thing to do that isn't related to being the President of the United States?
Hello Mr. President,

How do you find the challenge of balancing your work life and family life? Obviously running a country must be quite the busy job :)

P.S. Thanks for your work, from one of your northern neighbours!
Dear Mr. President, I'm a 28 year old Web Developer working at Indiana University.  My question is simple, how can you stand for the Marijuana Prohibition?  You seem like a pretty logical straight shooting guy, but you obviously are allowing for this ridiculous situation to continue.  From one man to my president, please speak up and help end this prohibition.
Nate Silver's analysis at [fivethirtyeight.com](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/) currently has you at a 68.7% chance to win in November.  As you probably know his [2008 predictions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver#2008_U.S._elections) for both the presidential and senate races were very accurate.

How does your outlook compare with his?
Mr. President, is there anything you plan on doing to force the Federal Housing Finance Agency to refinance more mortgages? Including attempting to replace DeMarco with someone who will actually implement your agenda?

In a different direction, do you have any comments on monetary policy? Do you believe that Bernanke is doing enough easing given where the economy is right now?
Why does Romney think China needs to be labelled as a currency manipulator, won't doing that to one of our largest trading partners put the economy under greater pressure?

Welcome to Reddit President Obama!
Mister President,

Your role is one of, if not *the most* criticized position in the world. A President is blamed by lead-footed congress, disgruntled citizens, disconcerted millionaires, foreign leaders, celebrities, etc.

My question is this: What was your motivation for taking such a taxing and thankless position, and why on Earth would anyone want to willingly submit to that level of scrutiny a second time?
Mr. President, if Washington state passes initiative No. 502, which would legalize and tax the distribution of marijuana by the state to adults, how will you and the Department of Justice respond?
If you could meet any former president in some form of athletic competition. Who would you choose and what would be the sport?
I believe that the biggest problem facing Democrats is voter apathy amongst the younger population - I think that a lot more states would be blue if the youth vote could be mobilized.  How can you inspire the young to be more invested in choosing our leasers?
What are you doing to ensure that the NSA is not illegally aggregating huge amounts of data on millions of innocent Americans in legendary data warehouses? What are you doing to ensure that these activities are transparent enough that they can be checked by reasonable public scrutiny?

Thanks.
No question, just a sincere thank you for courageously doing what is unpopularly just and logical in American politics today
Why didn't you veto NDAA?
Mr. President, thanks for coming on and talking directly to the average, or maybe slightly below average, people. We really appreciate it.

I'm wondering how people can best support your campaign. I don't have a lot of disposable income these days to donate. I've done a little bit of phone banking through the local campaign office. Do you have any other suggestions for ways that I can help out?
Mr. President, the Republican minority in the Senate has decided to make it virtually impossible to get judicial nominees and other agencies. Why have you decided to not do more appointments during the periods when the Senate is out of session in order to fill these vital roles?
Mr. President, I voted for you and I will vote for you in November.  Although I must share some of my disappointment in the "Change" so far.
I expected to see real change with our false fears regarding Terrorism and the department of home land security.  In the previous administration I simply accepted it as right wing fear mongering to play to their base but I fully expected the present administration to get rid of or at least neuter this ineffective agency.  Event the name comes off as pure propaganda.  Why is this allowed to continue?
If you had to elect someone, other than yourself, to be President of the United States, who would it be and why?
I am a South African who has a keen interest in American politics, and I have a few questions for you, I would love for you to answer them.

1. What are you trying to do, to reunite democrats and republicans in congress so you can go back to problem solving.

2. Why did you sign the NDAA?

3. Are you thinking of bringing back the GlassSteagall Act

- Thanks 

*EDIT:** Rephrased question 1
With interest rates so low, borrowing money is essentially free right now.  Why are we not pouring as much as we can into significant infrastructure projects?  Doing so seems like a huge win, as it would provide much-needed jobs, along with providing us a solid base for future success.
What, Mr. President, is your favorite movie?
President Obama, the messaging from the White House during the healthcare debates seemed lacking. If you could go back, what would you do differently? 

Most parties agree that the Affordable Healthcare Act is incomplete, especially when it comes to cost control. What further steps would you take in your second term to help reign in the rising cost of healthcare in the US?

Even if you don't answer this question, thank you!
I have a marijuana question that I'd like to have ignored.
Wall street regulation. It's not a question. It needs to happen. I WORK ON WALL STREET and I think it needs to happen. The amount of damage done by only a handful of individuals, with ripples through our economy, is astounding. 

So the questions are... 
 * When will we see regulation (with teeth!)?
 * When will we see REAL prosecutions of financial terrorists?
 * When will we have the banks broken up (as ex CEO of Citi suggested) and bring back Glass Steagal?
 * When will we not have a revolving door with the SEC so that regulators can go work for banks?


Yes, my questions are all financial related. But then again -- it's the economy, stupid :)
False. I am in charlottesville watching you give a speech.
How do you think the American government can best transition to an electoral system that is not dominated by only two parties?
No question, just want to wish you the best for the upcoming election. (I'm not a US citizen, therefore can't vote)
President Obama. Thank you very much for the hard work you have done. 
1. thank you for supporting education. I also believe a better economy starts with educate people. can you provide more help for student loans? there are plenty of people that can even afford the loans. 

2. you have 1 vote here. Thank you thank you
How do you plan on refuting the baseless and false charge that the Romney campaign continues to make every day that your administration has "removed the work requirement from welfare"?

It seems like there is no longer any punishment in modern campaigning for false charges and lies.
Can we just get rid of the income cap on Social Security taxes, now at about $107,000 and solve this whole thing? I mean most of us have to pay on our whole salary so why not the more fortunate? Like Nike says just do it ;)
Hello Mr. President! How long do you anticipate your stay on Reddit?
Might be a question already but: What are your plans for education if you win another term? As far as the current budget cut crisis.
I can't imagine the stress of your daily life.  Even when on vacations, can you ever truly shut your brain off from all the responsibility you have and just enjoy yourself and your family?
Why do you feel that this is a good use of my dollars (as a taxpayer) and your time?  I mean, beyond the publicity in this election season, of course..
From where do you believe your power derives?
Hello Mr. President, glad to have you answer questions here.  When you win your next term, what is the biggest policy goal that you will pursue that hasn't been regarded much by the media?
I very recently became a United States citizen (90 days ago), thus making this the first Presidential Election I can participate in. I'm pretty stoked! No questions, just a big HI!!!!
Mr. President,


Can you say why America is the greatest county in the world?
Whoa! Awesome! Hi Mr. Obama!

I hope you get elected. Mitt Romney scares the bejeezus out of me. 


Question: How stressful is it to be President? It seems to me like it would be the biggest burden ever.
If you could be one member of the Avengers, which would it be?
How do you feel about all the bad press your republican competition has been getting? How do you make sure that you are not going to be made fun of on Jon Stewart, Late Night, etc.
What one issue or piece of legislation would you like to see addressed that is most likely to be obstructed by the republicans?
What do you think of the video of you singing call me maybe?

The country is careening toward an extremely deep and dangerous place in terms of the debt. Not placing blame here, plenty to go around. 

My question is, how on earth can we hope to avoid painful austerity for years and years? No single answer -- tax the rich, VAT, end loopholes, economic growth, means-testing entitlements, etc. -- will come anywhere close. Doing all of it would be tantamount to pushing Congress off a cliff, politically speaking. Most countries, it should be noted, eventually cave to currency devaluation (i.e., massive inflation).

Are you prepared to bet your legacy and final term to a real solution here? I seriously worry for generations of Americans to come.
Thanks for putting this on, I think it demonstrates exactly why you are the President this country needs. My question is what do you think the Federal government can be doing to help promote scientific literacy among the general population and how can we translate this into an increase in enrollment in science college programs?
Could I get a job in the secret service, FBI or CIA?
Mr Obama. Please save the world by winning this election. It's not only Americans that need you. 

Love from Australia
this has to be a white house page or pr person doing this...
Everyone can agree that the current state of American politics is basically in shambles. People can get along great until you find out you each vote for different politicians, and all of a sudden you're mortal enemies. What would say American citizens, the media, and politicians need to do to solve this? If things keep going this way, we can all agree we're looking at hard times ahead.
I must ask you a question that is necessary for the well being of the country.

May you sing some more Al Green?
Mr. President, can you give a quick run down on why young people (18-24) should vote for you instead of Mitt Romney?
Did you learn things when you became president that would blow the average citizen's minds?
Mr. President, as young adolescent from a small town in Ohio, I would just like to ask if you think the Baltimore Orioles will make the playoffs. That is all. Thank you. Your presidency is also doing very well as well, I believe.
Welcome to Reddit President Obama.

I have question in regards to LGBT rights. What are your ideals for the next term as president in regards to marriage rights, taxing rights, hospital visitation, adoption rights, and discrimination in schools/workplaces, etc.? And what steps can be taken to put these ideas into national and/or state law?
Thank you for taking the time to answer questions Mr. President.  

Does the First Lady know about this food stand?  

http://childhoodobesityblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/heart-attack-cafe.jpg

It has a sign on the side: that says Michelle Obama doesn't endorse their food.  http://blogs.ocweekly.com/stickaforkinit/rsz_picture_3.jpg

As somebody with a strong interest to become a politician, what do you feel are some of the most critical skills required to succeed in the field?
Mr. President, how do you feel the presidency has affected you personally in terms of your relationship with long-standing friends and family, i.e. people who were there from the beginning?

Also, thanks for all you do. I know you've got the hardest job in the country and no matter how anyone feels about the decisions you make, they must respect the burden you bear in making them.
Hello Mr. President, I'm an Iranian national and want to kindly ask when will we be seeing US and Iran sitting on a table without pre-conditions to talk their difference and come to consensus and mutual understanding and respect. I think it's not only for the benefit of themselves but to the world.
Which is more important to you, jobs or education?
I'm going to need a picture of you with today's paper and a shoe on your head, Mr President.
What was/is the single biggest factor making the changes promised during your campaign difficult to achieve? What can the people do to minimize the impact of that factor?
Thanks for doing this.
So, here it goes, 
Years from now, it's your last few days in office, I am sure you will want to leave a note for the next guy(or girl) to get the job. What do you leave? What advice do you try to leave behind for them? Or do you think your presidency will be so unique that you advice and experience will only apply to you?
The college system is pretty geared toward students who perform well on standardized tests, and certain aspects of the ways GPA is calculated mean that it's very difficult for a student whose interests lie in areas that are less easily translated to commercial enterprise but that are equally vital, like art, music, theatre, etc. As one of these students, and a peer of many others in similar situations, being able our skills into a viable source of livelihood is important. Is there anything you can do, or have considered doing, to help kids like me still manage to make our way in this country?

Either way, you get my vote. I'm thankful for everything you've done and everything you've tried to do. Keep fighting the good fight; this is one term where I think the "silent majority" is actually on your side. Whatever the GOP does to try and obfuscate the real work you're doing, I'll keep trying to clear the way.
How do you think the current political climate can change from being as toxic as it is now into something that is more workable and bipartisan?
I'm so shocked that I don't even know how to react. I'm happy that you try to connect to the people :) I was going to vote for you before, and I am happy to give my vote to you.

What has been you favorite thing that you have done while being president? Has there been anything that you would like to do again?
Mr. President,

What do you plan to do about the inevitable student loan bubble?  How is it acceptable for the most potentially beneficial members to society to be burdened with debt when they are just starting out in 'adult' life. 

Thanks for your time.
Who's your pre-season Super Bowl pick?
Mr. President, you stated at the beginning of your term that if the economy didn't turn around under your leadership in 3 years, you would be facing a one year presidency. For context: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCN5-ovvFL0

Considering our economy is still down, would you care to explain what happened and how you hope to move this along?
Mr. President, it is an honor to type to you. Could you please explain to us what you thought of PIPA and SOPA?
I'm from the UK, and I have a great deal of respect for what you're trying to do in America, I believe you are the catalyst that can make America great again.

My question to you, Mr President, is this.  Which former president do you respect the most, and why?
Here I am with the possibility of asking the President a question and my username is abagofdicks.

Thank you so much for doing this by the way and best of luck in the 2012 election! (try and lock my vote! :) )
Mr. President, 

I am finally old enough to be voting in my first election this year, and I have to say, it will be an honor to vote for you.

Also, I'll be 21 on July 6th, come hang out and have a beer with me in a year.
Why are you cracking down on medical marijuana dispensaries, when one  of your campaign promises was to lessen crackdowns?
do you ever wish you could just call the other side out on their BS, cop to the times your side has done the same, and agree to be civil and open with one another? you know - get rid of the political doublespeak and all the posturing?
President Obama, 

I will be casting my first vote this November, and I want you to know that you not only have earned my vote and respect, but are more deserving than any other candidate. 

Good Luck!

9 times out of 10 the candidate with the most money win their election. **What is your plan to address this issue?**

Seems to me the soultion is getting money out of politics, making the election publically finaced, instead of having private donors put huge money into election. In other words a constitutional amendment. 
**Would you support an idea like this and fight for it in your second term?**

Mr. President, how do you feel about SNLs skits about you?
What would you tell people who supported you during the last election, but perhaps have lost faith in your administration.
Mr. President, first let me say how happy I am to see you doing an AMA on Reddit. As the sensible son of a very right-wing family, I am proud of all the good you have done for this country, and am deeply saddened by the vilification and misunderstanding you often receive.

I donate to your campaign as much as I possibly can, but it seems like I am getting emails from your campaign team twice a day asking for more. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a complaint. I understand that you need all the help you can get and the emails are probably automated, but as a young person who works three jobs to pay the bills, I've put every extra dollar I have into donations to your campaign and I want to say I'm sorry I don't have more to give. I don't really have a question for you, I guess. Just that.
Can any President every be effective again with the conquers-all-logic partisanship of many of today's politicians?
It is believed by many that the 112th Congress has been the "Do Nothing" Congress. Many members of the Republican party have made it their political goal over your first term to obstruct many of your biggest initiatives with the purpose of making you lose this upcoming election and be a single-term President. Do you feel that once you win a second term that things will improve and they will be forced to work with you? Do you have any ideas as to how to bring about more legislative progress?
Mr. President, it's a pleasure!  Do you mind that the ACA is informally known as Obamacare?  It has taken on a pejorative tone and I think it undermines the importance of its effects.

And, thank you for the ACA.  I look forward to our country catching up to the rest of the industrialized world.  I'm proud to have voted for you.
Your economic policy goals can hardly be implemented while the GOP retains control of Congress, in particular the House.  Will the House elections and the issue of Congressional control -- and its impact on legislation affecting the economy and jobs - factor into the active discussion and debate during your reelection campaign?

It is incredible that I get to pose a question to the President of US from halfway across the globe, in India.

Do you think China and India will supercede USA as the education hub of the world? How do you hope your nation will compete with the talent coming out of China, India and South East Asia in general? 

Also, can the US play a part in instilling women-friendly attitudes in South Asian countries where gender parity is huge? Thanks a lot. Namaste!

Hello there Obama! Im Lauren and I would like to know, with the September 17th approaching and the 2nd Occuversary of the Occupy Wall Street coming up, what are your feeling about the movement, its motives and what steps will you take to bring the issues we are so passionate about ( bank bailouts, jobs, student loans) into this election?
You've expressed optimism that Republicans will be more willing to work with you in a second term. Why do you think they would be more flexible than in the past? They don't seem to be changing their tune on anything, based on last night's convention speeches at least.
Who is your childhood hero?
What has your administration done to prepare for the impending zombie invasion?
Your administration has engaged in what has been called a military "strategic pivot" to East Asia, which is understood to also be aimed at China.

However, as our economy becomes more intertwined with China, the prospect of arms buildup and military containment of China seems less and less sensible.

How can you rationalize your military posture with China, and what will you do in your second term to promote peace and economic cooperation with China?

Mr. President,
Thank you for participating in this--you truly are in touch with your target voters. As a college student graduating in May 2013, I am curious if you have any programs aside from healthcare and education cost reform that would benefit new graduates?
In the campaign against Mitt Romney, how do you plan to fight against his ads and his campaign's decision to simply ignore the media and the press when he is called out on lies?  

For example, his ads attacking the waiver requests for welfare reform from Republican governors or an entire convention built around an out of context quote?
I would love to see more incentives to keep jobs in the country and to bring back jobs that have gone. When the anchor industries of our communities leave towns go into downward spirals and we see this clearly in places like Camden,NJ, Dearborn and Detroit, MI, Gary, In. It seems that maintaining and reviving these anchors is at the core of solving so many problems including drug abuse, gang activities, violence, foreclosures and high school drop out rates. 
What are your plans to deal with things like this in the next 4 years and can you please tackle things like lobbyists and Wall Street regulation. There are many solutions to these problems and so many people would benefit from a clear plan and concerted efforts. Thank you
Hi Mr. President. I'm one of your campaign Fellows at a certain large swing-state university, and I've seen the insane amounts of work and time that volunteers and organizers are putting into the campaign. It makes it a little bit depressing to know that we're fighting so much money and messaging from right-leaning super PACs and donors. How do you think you could try to change campaign finance law during your second term so that it's harder for anonymous monied interests to have such an outsized influence on the race, and overshadow grassroots organizing?
Just dropping by to show my support. Best of luck in the upcoming months, President Obama
You put forward a big vision for American politics in *The Audacity of Hope*. What have you noticed about this vision while spending a term in leadership? Would you like to add anything or make further observations on what you've learned about the challenges and opportunities in America?
Why haven't taxes been simplified over the years? They become more and more complicated. If taxes were simplified and straight forward it seems like we'd be able as a country to have our finances better organized and be more productive with our time.

Thanks for doing this and thanks for being awesome in general.

As an American living in Canada My husband and I talk a lot about moving to the states. But it's a tough sell as my husband is a teacher here in Canada. He sees no incentives in being a teacher in he USA and no opportunity. If elected for a second term, what are your plans for education in the US and how will you plan on helping teachers provide a better education for our students.
Thank you so much in advance for doing this. What an amazing way to reach voters! ;)
Four year veteran here, Mr. President. I just wanted to say that you've done a terrific job during your term. It wasn't easy given the hand that you were dealt by President Bush. Please know that many of us out there still love and respect you as our Commander in Chief (regardless of what happens at the election or what is in the public polls) and it has been an honor serving under you.
Mr. President,

How has the job of being the President of the United States and the Leader of the "Free World" impacted your life?  It was obviously a rather-large change to your day-to-day life, but do you think it's made you a better person for the things you've seen/dealt with, or do you think it's more of a negative experience, with the stress of it all outweighing any positive benefits?
How big of an impact do you expect social media to have this campaign season? How is your campaign using it to gain an edge?

Also, because I'm basically required to ask - Would anyone from the Obama 2012 campaign be interested in participating in Syracuse University's [#ElectionClass](http://electionclass.com/)? I'm sure they'd love to have you!
Mr. President, I am the CTO of a social network startup. Last year there was an online protest against several internet-control related bills. Ultimately, you [backed](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/01/14/obama-administration-responds-we-people-petitions-sopa-and-online-piracy) the anti-SOPA/PIPA movement and helped squash the bills.

What are you thoughts about social network innovations and the freely flowing information vs. intellectual property rights?

How do you propose to balance the [seemingly](http://scifiandgadgets.com/2011/07/15/netflix-killed-by-the-mpaa-where-do-we-go-now/) [opposing](http://ycombinator.com/rfs9.html) interests of large copyright holders vs. new internet innovators?

EDIT: added reference links
What's for dinner?
Mr. President, you campaigned on "No new taxes for families making under $250,000 a year." Yet, the Supreme Court ruled that the PPACA is infact a tax. Do you plan on addressing this with some form of tax relief?

Also, because insurers keep a pool to help offset premiums for the next year, they are having to pay out from this pool, and then recollect it (because of the provision of spending 80% on premiums), which doesn't lower the cost for end users at all. Will there be amendments to stop this kind of abuse?

Thank you for your service.
Do you watch Warehouse 13? Anything close too/like it? Or total sci-fi?
Please tell us, in your own words, just how much influence powerful interests have over our mainstream media, and if you would describe it all as a type of propaganda.
Why do you allow the GOP to continually bully and whine and cry their way into getting what they want, rather than bringing down the proverbial hammer and using the bully pulpit that is the Office of the President? Even if you don't win the battles, the American people, especially those on the left, want to see you fight for something beyond a neutered compromise. 

Why have you let Wall Street off the hook for their role in destroying our economy? Related to this question: Why does Eric Holder, one of the least effective Attorneys General that I can remember in my lifetime, still have a job?
Bath or shower?
Why should the labor movement support you after you and your administration threw workers unceremoniously under the bus by not showing up in Wisconsin and appointing Arne Duncan Secretary of Education? Why don't you ever publicly stand up for the rights of workers to organize even as these rights are being relentlessly assaulted by the right wing in this country? Why should workers vote for you again after receiving such treatment?

Mr. President, thanks for taking the time to do an AMA. I work for a small LGBT newspaper based in Atlanta called The Georgia Voice. Would you allow me 20 minutes of your time for a telephone interview sometime before the November election? I'd love to talk about DOMA repeal efforts and other outstanding issues still affecting the LGBT community.
I'm from San Antonio, and would love to know if you think Mayor Julian Castro could one day be in the Oval Office himself. Could his upcoming DNC keynote address catapult his career as it once did for you?
What made you decide to post on such a public open forum like this? I mean there's the obvious reasons. For me when i saw the headline i thought "this cant be real". The fact that im typing something that the president of my country might actually look at is a mind blowing thought itself. What is the overall goal for you posting on reddit?
If you could travel back to 2009 and do the first three and a half years of your presidency over again, what would you do differently?
What inspired you to do a Reddit AMA?

I hope this question doesn't get buried, but it's actually the first one that came to my mind. You literally could have chosen any media outlet in the world to do a Q&A, and you've chosen Reddit. Why?
Mr president, 

Did you ever watch the west wing on TV, how close is it to the actual white house and your experiences as president?
When is the Stargate program going to be declassified?
First off, thank you Mr. President for taking the time to do this AMA. In you're second term, should you win this November, what would you do to advance LGBT rights, especially around marriage?
Thanks for doing this AMA Mr. President. 

What effort is your administration taking towards functional and profitable green energy? Mr Romney's plan to drill in the U.S. worries me, but the lack of a breakthrough in alternative methods of fuel also concerns me. 

Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA!
Are you sure we're not talking to a PR person or an intern?
Mr. President how do you plan on working with Republicans to try and remove some of the animosity from both sides? Seems like each side hates the other so much nothing gets done.
With all of the partisan bickering, what are you doing to help increase cooperation?  Why does it always have to be about our differences?  We have Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, etc., but we're all Americans.  Why can't we focus on this?
What is your favourite breakfast food? Or cereal if you take cereal? For reference I like Froot Loops. But we can't really get them here in England.
Rudest encounter you've had as President? 

Your take on Ron Paul and the RNC?
Mr. President, I think The Newsroom is shedding a great light on the inferiority of our ratings-driven media system. Do you plan on tackling this problem? How do we ensure honesty and integrity in journalism when it is all but absent in today's sensationalism and entertainment-driven day and age?
Mr President, what will you do to create a path to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants in this country?
If you could chose one topic to focus this election on and none other, what would it be and why do you feel this topic is the most important to us as a country? Also I would like to say thank you so far for everything you've done and it may not be much but you have my full support this election!
What is the one thing about yourself that you wish people people truly understood but you feel many do not.
What, in your opinion, is the number one priority goal for the United States over the next fifty years?
Does your administration have any plans to release the White House Honey Ale recipe? Also, did you take part in brewing the beer? What's your favorite beer?
What is more important for an elected official, to represent the platform that they were elected on, or to represent to wishes of the constituents (Including those who didn't vote for them)?
Mr. President: What can be done about these current waves of voter suppression?  Regardless of one's political affiliations, the right to vote ought to be sacrosanct in any aspiring democracy, and in the United States these transgressions have been particularly egregious throughout our history.  I am concerned that your opponent, Mr. Romney, may be declared winner without actually winning.
How do you feel about everyone putting you down? You always seem like it doesnt phase you.
You said today, whilst visiting the great commonwealth of Virginia, that "Higher education isn't a luxury, it is an economic necessity for every single American."

This strikes me as unrealistic and ill-advised. Isn't the value of a college degree to degree holders based in its relative scarcity in the same way that the scarcity of money gives it value?
Hey mods! Are you aware that Barack is misspelled in the sidebar? JUST SAYIN
President Obama, how can we get higher voter turnout for this years election compared to previous elections?
And also, may I come over for a beer summit?
It's an honor to have you here, Mr. President
Why do you allow the fiction that civilian casualties due to drone strikes are all enemy combatants? And what makes your drone campaign legally different than what Kissinger did in Laos and Cambodia?
Thanks for doing this. What do you regret most about your first term in office? How would you like to change this when you get re-elected?
I feel compelled to make my mark on this historic thread. 

What if early presidents had the opportunity to reach tens of thousands of citizens in an informal setting such as this?

Thanks, Mr. President!
good luck from the uk..... are there any accusations thrown at you that really made you think WTF?
One of the downsides to the electoral college is that people who don't live in swing states feel less inclined to vote, since generally their state will always go to the Democratic party or to the Republican party, regardless of who the candidates are. Do you think the electoral college system should be reformed to attempt to increase voter turnout?
Thanks so much for this AMA very excited. I am a very big supporter of you and you definitely will have my vote this fall. My question is about something my economic professor brought up last semester. 

What do you plan to do with the soon to be coming inflation due to the amount of dollar printing you did with the stimulus package and the GDP's inability to match the proper growth rate?
Mr. President,
  I think it is amazing you are doing this. I think my biggest concern for the next 4 years is how are we as a country are going to address the growing debt of our young working class  namely  the rising cost of tuitions and education? How do we plan to address the new financial crisis that is our educational national debt and the collateralization of our generation of citizens?

Sorry if this is a repeat.
What do you make of the Republican motto "I built this?" (as it references your comments that were clearly pointing to the structures of society and not the individual effort it took to metaphorically construct their business)
What will you do to help students who are struggling to pay for school?
my daughter went to one of the top ranked public high schools in the country but we couldn't afford the tutors needed to fill in what her math teachers didn't teach and she didn't pass the precal class needed to return to school this fall. why aren't public schools held accountable for the effectiveness of their teaching?
The Republican Party has been fighting you tooth and nail for the past 4 years, severely limiting what you can actually do to help recover our economy. If you're re-elected, do you see any of this changing or is everyone in Congress going to sit on their hands again while the country burns around them?
Who or what brought you to do an AMA on here?
Do you know that you are a meme?
Welcome to Reddit Mr. President!

I only have one question for you. How do you feel with everybody blaming you for Clinton's stupidity? Personally I hate all politics. But, I think its stupid how people are pointing fingers at you for something that started many years ago.
I'm a recent college graduate who is having trouble finding work. What are your plans to reduce youth unemployment in your second term, and how do your plans differ from your first term?
Hi President Obama!

How much sleep would you say you get per night, on average?  Thank you Mr. President-sir!
Mr. President: unrestricted corporate money is flooding our politics at the local, state and federal level - and changing the shape of our government. Individuals are able to donate enormous sums of money to 501(c)(4) groups and others without any transparency or disclosure. This creates obvious conflicts of interest and can lead to corruption. 

How would you address this problem in your second term? How can we change this?
Mr President, thank you so much for time. In your opinion what was the most important element of Dodd-Frank and do you feel that there are any further reforms to Wall St legislation that should be explored in your second term.
As the most powerful man in America, and possibly the world, can you get me a pardon for oversleeping and forgetting to see my fiancee off for her trip?  She's super stubborn...

PS: You rock, and have my vote without question.
Are you considering any school loan debt reform? I'll be honest, that's probably an easy way to get the young vote.
Mr. President - thank you for trying your hardest in term despite the bi partisan troubles. 

My question: Given the compounding student loan debt in this country and the economic tax it weighs on the young 20 somethings (and older!), will we expect any legislation to help with this looming bubble if you are elected for another term?
No question...I just wanted to tell you how proud of you I am.  My husband was a casual acquaintance of yours at Occidental and we are proud of the way you have represented our Country and the People of the United States.

Thank you
What was the hardest question you've ever had to answer? Be it from anyone -- whether it's the media or your own daughters. And what was your answer?
Mr. President, what's our chance of getting something like the autobhan? 
But more seriously, how are you going to keep fighting hard for equality for the gay community?
I'm an international student who will start his first year in an American college. Not only that I don't have the same access of grands and financial aid, there are tremendous hurdles and mountains of paperwork that my potential employers have to do in order to hire me after I graduate. How would you respond?
Why was Guantanamo bay not closed as promised?

If you had to do the last four years over again, what's one thing you would change that would make America a better place.  
Also, can you just admit that aliens are real?
What is your opinion on the new format of college football post season?
Mister President, What are your plans to fund higher education and sciences, and to help fund research and innovation and promote kids to become engineers and scientists to help restore our country to its former grandeur?
First, I want to just say thank you for doing this. Also, I think you're a truly admirable person. I think Michelle is an incredible First Lady as well.

How difficult is it to keep the fierce political climate from affecting your family life? Did you always know you wanted to do this? (be president)
Why keep ignoring the overwhelming call to legalize marijuana? You work for the people Mr.President not the other way around. If 51% want it,it should happen.
What does an average day for you consist of?

What is your opinion of Noam Chomsky?
Mr. President, I am a huge supporter but I have been disheartened by the obstruction on behalf of the Republicans in congress these past four years. Their unwillingness to compromise on anything during your first term, it is just not how congress has worked in the past. From the Debt ceiling debacle, to withholding funds from the post office and air traffic controllers.

It is time to call them out on these actions. Time to stand your ground on issues and not always seem to be giving in to their demands. If you are re-elected can we expect a much harder stance when it comes to dealing with the obstruction in congress, and their willingness to hold the country hostage over seemingly small petty political issues?
What is preventing marijuana legalization for adults?
I feel proud to be an American with a president like you.
What plans do you have to fix social security?
Why do you think current legislators on both sides of Congress refuse to work together across the aisle like they did in the past, and what do you think could be done to improve things?  This didn't seem like such a problem in the past, and it's very frustrating.
What is your best solution to fair corporate taxing such that certain companies don't get unfair advantages which cause jobs to go overseas?

"President Obama was scheduled to speak at today's Greenpeace conference but a reporter from the White House has informed us that he's been on the internet social board Reddit for the past four hours. When asked for a quote, Obama was stated to say, 'I'm glad Michelle isn't OAG."
The UK, amongst other countries, gives very powerful extradition powers to the USA by treaty. Citizens such as Gary McKinnon face being extradited with weak evidence for crimes that may not even be crimes in the UK.

How do you feel about the USA forcing their laws on countries that have democratically decided on their own laws?  Would you ever consider allowing the USA to extradite its citizens for offenses not defined in the USA?
Being a person who was raised without religion, but later adopted it, how do you feel about the shift away from religion and toward intellectualism that seems to be occurring with the younger generations of Democrats?
Mr. President, I gladly voted for you in 2008 and will again this year, but I'm really concerned by your support of the targeted killing of U.S. citizens, such as Anwar Al-Awlaki, without the due process of law. In your second term, will you reconsider this policy? And will you uphold your promise of transparency around military and administration policies and practices related to targeted killing and signature strikes?
If things don't go according to plan, and you do end up losing your presidency, what do you plan on doing? will you continue go back to being senator?

also, when did the white house start sending birthday cards??
Are you watching the Paralympics? :D
What do you see as Mitt Romney's main faults, both professionally and personally?
How can the office of the POTUS do more to combat false information that is is so loudly shouted from the extreme right that continues to make our elections less about true substance and more about theologic issues?
Campaign strategy question.  Your opponent hasn't released his tax returns.  I doubt there's anything strictly illegal to be found, but it's pretty clear his tax rate has been extremely low and he's used many complicated tricks that aren't available to most Americans to keep it that way.

At what point do you decide to address this in the campaign?  How do you avoid sinking to the level of baseless innuendo?

If I were you, I would say something like "Grow up and pay your damn taxes, Mitt.  No one is impressed by the way you've shifted money through the Caymans."
Why is our CIA funding and arming Al Qaeda in Syria, yet you allow TSA to grope us in fear of them here?
Hello Mr. President. I would like to ask if you feel that there is any chance that we can push for medicare for all after you have secured your second term in November. Also, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for all that you've worked so hard to get done for ALL of us!
Mr. President, I just want to thank you for everything you have done for the queer community. Whatever happens in the next year or so, we can take solace in the fact that individuals in power, such as yourself, have actually made a difference in the quality of our lives, in a social sphere that many wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole and rubber gloves. The world is changing, and at least for your LGBTQ citizens, you've made it brighter.
Is there really a book holding a ton of national secrets that only the President of the United States has access to?
Hello Mr. President. Are you worried about voter suppression in the Swing states, and if so, what is your campaign doing about it? 
I also love you and was a campaign volunteer for you in 2008. I drove old folks to the polls! 
Fired up, ready to go!
I'm a dutch journalism student soon to start a research paper about the elections. Could I interview you?
The President. I'd like to ask something with meaning, but I am at a loss. Therefore, I will ask:

What do you plan to do if you are not reelected? And if you are, what are the three most important goals you have that you find pertinent to complete before your *next* term is over? What is your favorite cereal?
What is it like running democrat and supporting 

* Wars you campaigned on ending by 2009 
* Indefinate detention of US citizens (your language) 
* Gitmo 
* Legislation enabling state propaganda 
* Expansion of a police state with runs on ammunition to give local state governments.
What is your favorite food?
Can Michelle beat you in an arm wrestling match?
What do you think about donating 30% of political contributions mandatory for any candidate that raises over $5k. It'll keep funding proportionally the same, but will actually do some good for the people.
Would you consider adding a Nationwide Fiber Optic Network to your platform? Seems to me it is the perfect economic stimulus short term (Construction jobs at multiple levels nationwide) and long term (Increase of ability for telecommuting, e-commerce, lower costs for businesses to run, etc.) Which would also get cars off the road long term.
If good ol' Romney and you got into a fist fight who would win?
Hello, Mr. President. What is your administration's perspective on international development as a means of preemptive national defense? I've noticed USAID has become very focused on concentrating humanitarian assistance in locations prone to religious extremism in the years since you've been elected - do you view this as a viable way forward with Pakistan and Afghanistan?

Mr. President,

I am 28 yrs old, born in Israel and came to this country at the age of 4. And yet, I am still am an undocumented American. 

I thank you for your work with Deferred Action and I, with SO MANY others, have applied and many already step closer to a work permit to help provide for this country. 

And yet, it is not enough. How can we get Congress, whether Republicans or Democrats, to see this issue more seriously and in a more  humane matter? 

Recently I, with 35 others, led by Jose Antonio Vargas, were on the cover of TIME Magazine on this issue. And through out the conversation I am finding more and more Americans empathizing and agreeing that The Dream Act or something of it like must be passed. Why can't Congress see that and what can we do to help them see it as a human issue? And if elected for another term, what will you do to ensure that we are a step closer to the Dream Act or full out immigration reform? 

(And before anyone on this thread says I am a "waste of space", I say I was valedictorian, I have headed volunteer programs for various non profits, I have helped start many "running teams" that raised money for charity and I will stop here, as modesty is a virtue).

Hello Mr. President,
Can you comment on the four U.S. soldiers at Ft. Stewart recently arrested for plotting to take over the base, bomb local targets and assassinate you? Is there a screening process being developed to help weed out potentially dangerous individuals serving in the military?

How come you're giving medical marijuana users such a hard time? I realize there are a ton of obstacles and lots of exploitation of the MMJ programs, but there are a lot of innocent people getting caught in the cross hairs as well. 

What do you have planned for the future in terms of medical marijuana? Thank you, sir.
Hey Mr President! Awesome to see you take on a AMA, it's super cool. Any plans on coming back to Ireland? We'd love you back!
What would it take for you to accept the recommendations of the Simpson-Bowles Deficit Commission?
In your first term you made a lot of effort to gain bipartisan support but this seemed to be detrimental. If re-elected will you do the right thing even if the opposition don't agree.
As an Ohio (and pro-Obama) resident, it seems that there is an endless amount of pro-Romney ads on TV. Do you have plans to increase your media presence here through TV ads/another medium? Or is this due to Romney leading the fundraising battle (and thusly, having more to spend on tv slots)?
I want to know if the president watches The Newsroom and what he thinks of the show.

Hi, Mr. President- I'd just like to say that it's incredibly cool of you to be on reddit. You were my first-ever Presidential vote, and I can promise you a repeat in November.. and I would be thrilled to play basketball with you the next time you're in Los Angeles.

Silly question: Do I really need to be a senior citizen to get a birthday note from you? I sent in a fax sometime last week, and I would be ecstatic to get a note from you when April rolls around.
Hi Mr. President,

I think you've done a good job so far with a tough situation these last few years. I have a quick question or two for you:

How do you balance between protecting personal liberties (e.g., privacy, free speech) and ensuring American security against terrorism and other threats? Did your perspective change when you became president?

Also, I saw your presidential motorcade pass by in Boulder, but you were hidden behind dark glass. Did you wave back at me when I waved hi to you? =)
Why does the Patriot Act still exist? I am not a fan of my elected government spending money to record everything my fellow citizens and I do on a daily basis. Land of the free? I have to disagree.
If you had been caught with marijuana or cocaine when you were using those drugs, your life could have been ruined because of criminal charges. How can you be so cruel and hypocritical in supporting the criminal prohibition of these drugs? Why not implement evidence-based drug policies?

Why didn't you ever denounce the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as constituting Nuremberg's "supreme international crime?" (neither initial attack had UN Security Council approval, and neither were in response to an imminent threat. that makes these wars illegal). Why not prosecute your own predecessors for these crimes that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths in those two countries?

Why not support single payer, when there is mounting evidence of it being more efficient and providing better care for Americans? 

Why not drastically reduce the bloated, wasteful military budget? 

Why is there zero hard evidence of Bin Laden's killing having happened the way the official story says it did? Even if the official story is correct, why not detain him and bring him to trial? (you are a constitutional law professor, after all). 

Why don't you thoroughly read Ralph Nader's letters to you and seriously consider the points? (eg. http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/06/29/touching-letters-from-barack-obama/)
Mr. President how do you feel when people say that you aren't doing enough for your country?
(Which I completely disagree with.)
These questions are rather controversial so I honestly don't expect an answer.
  
  * Why has the raids on Marijuana dispensaries increased during your time in office even though you said something along the lines that it would stop?
      

* Why was NDAA passed, and how isn't it unconstitutional?
I haven't seen anybody asking this here yet, but what's with the recent changes on your Medical Marijuana stances? Or, why not work to see it allowed through the entirety of the US?  (Maybe you are and I just haven't seen it yet/haven't seen the correct info yet.)

Also, as a side note, thanks for being a boss!
How do you ethically justify authorizing the indefinite detainment of American citizens?
I am a recent graduate from the University of Chicago, and I sang the National Anthem with my a cappella group at your rally on our campus in 2010. I studied policy, politics, and government, all issues I am highly passionate about. My question for you is simple:

Can you get me a job?
For sure hope to have questions about college affordability answered

How do you feel about changing U.S. tax law to end offshore havens that allow the wealthy elite to get away with not paying their fair share?

I understand this isn't something you could implement alone, but do you at least support it?
Mr. President, I have heard that there are many comfortable amenities built specifically for the President's leisure. So I just have to ask: What is the best perk about living in the White House?
What is worse, and should be punished more severely - committing crimes at the highest levels of government, or exposing said crimes to the public?
Don't have any particular questions, but good luck in the election. Keep up the good work
When you were 5, what did you want to grow up to be?
Thanks for everything, sir. You can count on my vote again!

What do you think you'll do in 2016 after these next four years in office?
Mr. President, how confident do you feel about your re-election chances? Just curious. Personal (canadian) Obama supporter here
Mr. President,
(i've always wanted to actually say that.  Impersonal and on the internet will due.)

I want to thank you for passing health care so that citizens, like myself, with preexisting conditions have a chance at health care.  I would also like to thank you for staying relatively consistent on things that matter and compromising when necessary.  I applaud those characteristics.

I would like to take my miniscule chance to call your attention to the dearth of funding for Fusion research.  Nuclear fusion has been funded at the "50 years on" level for 30 years now.  Can you try to change the pace.  A fusion breakthrough would be a breakthrough for the nation and some steroids for the national science consciousness.  I've included a link for your and most likely your staff to peruse.

thank you for this oppurtunity.

Mr. President,

Why did you refuse from the get-go to include the issue of physician tort reform on the table during the healthcare reform debates?
What is your biggest regret of your presidency so far? And how will that regret influence your agenda for a second term if you get one?
Can I have a job?
What made you answer questions on an online forum?  I'm sure there are more pressing matters as President of the US.
I am so excited that you are here today sir. Please take a moment to understand this: I am scared out of my mind that Mitt Romney will win the election. Please do everything you can to ensure that this man does not become president. He will ruin everyones lives. You must for the sake of our future, either figure out a way to win this election (ie. federal cannabis legalization) or team up with Ron Paul or something. Do anything. Do something, I do not want America to turn into a Christian Nation. If Romney Wins, we are doomed to an ever-growing radically christian nation that will never stop growing once it starts, like the most cancerous of tumors. I beg you, please stop this man from winning the presidential election of 2012.

Also, have you ever visited the Calgary Stampede? Would you consider coming for an official visit to the Stampede during your next term?
How has the presidency affected you personally. Stress level wise, emotionally, or any other way you can think of?
I'll likely never have another opportunity to speak directly to you, so I want to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you've done. I'm proud to have you as my president.  No question, just a thank you.
I'm gay and have a boyfriend in the military. I'm extremely grateful that thanks to your administration that I'm allowed to even engage in this relationship. It blows my mind to think that just a few years ago this wouldn't be possible.

Gay marriage is a huge debate right now, but it would have an especially large impact on our lives if it was passed. Most other married couples receive great benefits from the military when they marry, but we won't be afforded these unless gay marriage is allowed on a federal level. 

So, is this something I can hope for?
Can we put a stop to the lobbyist in Washington?
Mr President - about the Romney Tax debacle - it's not that we care that Mitt Romney is rich. Americans love the rich - Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, even the Kardashians. The reason it's important to see what he pays is to make the point that Romney's entire fiscal platform is hypocritical. The money isn't getting invested back into America, as he claims tax cuts for the top 1% will do. The money is staying in offshore havens. Why isn't this point made more clearly by your administration?
What can we expect from your second term in office?
Mr. President, any chances of us seeing the metric system anytime soon?
Student debt has now surpassed credit card debt, and is above USD 1 trillion. It has been recognized by many sources as one of the greatest crises of our day. What do you intend to do about it? And more than just fix the debt problem now, how do you intend to make higher education affordable so that we don't have to face this problem again in the future?

I also hope you push for gay rights to be normal rights, and thankfully you do understand science (unlike some candidates). I also hope for internet freedom as much traffic goes through the internet. I'd love it if you could make a lot of the government who decide on things (not too sure of how it works over there, basically whatever MPs are) to read up on how the internet works.

Love from the UK :)
Mr. President. Just want to thank you for your efforts in improving this country. I just want to say with all the political environment mudslinging against you out there, how do you not let it get you down sometimes? Also now that you are president how do your daughters view politics? Also if there was one president in history you would like to grab a beer with who would it be?
What is the most disappointing thing about being president?
Seriously, the marijuana thing. Do you and Gil Kerlikowske and Michelle Leonhart really believe there is no medical benefit when states throughout our great union have been legalizing for medical use and decriminalizing for posession? Isn't it time to have a *real* and open discussion about, at the *very least* federal action, i.e., rescheduling to a level equal to, say, methamphetamine?
Mr. President, what drove you to do an AMA on Reddit?
I'm a student In England, yet I would still like to ask you a question.

What is the thing you miss the most since becoming president?
What do you do when you want to escape the whole being President of the United States thing?

What should we, as an online community, do to ensure your reelection?
Wow. This was quite a suprise. 
What kind of dental cream do you use?
In hindsight, and considering the stellar job done by Gerry McCarthy and the Chicago Police Dept with NATO, are you still glad you moved the G8 to Camp David?
Mr President,

The internet is (as this AMA indicates) becoming the de facto voice of the people, especially young people. But greedy telecoms and frankly ignorant legislators are continually attempting to regulate and limit its viability as a platform for free speech (SOPA, anti net neutrality, etc). Will you guarantee us that you will ensure the internet will always be free and open, with the absolute minimum of interference by corporations and government?

Thank you for taking the time to do this. -devin

Mr. President, 

Next time you're in Orlando, Fl, would you like to get lunch? I know a great BBQ place around town. :) 

I'd love to hear what you have to say about the state of our economy in relation to patent laws and our foreign policy on china. Also, tax code reform. Perhaps also the orlando magic. :)

Mr. President, if you had the opportunity to go back and do one thing differently in your first term, what would that be? 

OR

If you had the opportunity to change any specific decision made by a President within the past 50 years, what would that be?
Why don't you adopt a non interventionist foreign policy, like that of Ron Paul. One that increases defense spending and decreases military spending. That way of operation would without a doubt make America safer and at the same time promote a positive opinion of America on a global scale?

What future actions would your administration take to curb the very serious effects of global warming?
Mr. President, first let me say it's an honor to have you in such a public forum and have you reaching out to your constituents in this way.  Major kudos to you.

How do you see Washington bridging the gap currently in place between the "right" and "left"?  I feel like we're not all that different, but the rhetoric is so heated at times that it feels like we're being consistently told to hate this person, or hate that person, simply because of what they believe is best for the country.  How can the debate be turned into a intellectual discussion about plans for the country's future, and not simply a jab contest?
Would you support doubling the current NASA budget ? http://www.penny4nasa.org/
Mr President, thanks a lot for taking your time and doing this. It is most appreciated. 

Looking back on your term as President, is there anything you regret or wish you could have done differently? Also, do you believe that if reelected will you continue your presidency as you have been doing, or will there be changes in how you approach this tough job of yours. 

You don't have to answer, but I still thank you, even of you just reddit.

Why isn't Washington more proactive in dealing with the Syrian situation, Maybe you need to put pressure on Russia and China to stop them from VETOing anything useful for Syrians. Also, any plans for increasing NASAs budget if you get a 2nd term as a president?

Thank you.
Do you think the two party system is a strength or a weakness to America? Do you think having a third major political party would benefit our country?
What was your favourite moment of being a president?
Mr President, do you regret anything you said/promised in the campaign for the 2008 election?
Mr. President,

When you were still a US senator you and the first lady went to the Field Museum in Chicago to view the Treasures of King Tut's tomb (2006ish). I know because I ran the floor at the Field and made sure everyone was enjoying the museum.

My parents and younger sister were on the same tour as you that day, and although they enjoyed the exhibit, my mom and sister couldn't help but be upset at, "The tall guy in the suit with the hat on" because they couldn't see past you. Then they demanded we make a rule to have tall people stand behind short people. 

I tried to explain who you were...they didn't seem to care much at the time.

So what am getting at is: can you apologize to my mom and sister for blocking their view of King Tut's beautiful treasures?

Thanks in advance!

TLDR: Please apologize to my mom and sister for blocking their view of King Tut's treasures.
Energy is becoming an increasing concern. Current infrastructure is tailored to oil and gas and it currently isn't economically prudent to initiate a large scale conversion over to developing alternative sources. What are your plans to help stimulate energy R&D (ie. Fusion, hydrogen cells, solar), and will you continue to expand drilling for oil and gas in the name of economic growth in the mean time?

What do you have to say to all the people that you haven't taken enough charge of the government? That you're too weak willed to be an effective leader.
It seems to me that American politics have devolved into an "Us vs. Them" scenario. By this I mean that both the Republicans and Democrats are more interested in what's best for the party rather than what's best for the country. Is this an error in perception perpetuated by the media? If it isn't how do you plan to combat this if you get re-elected? If it is an error in perception, what can we do as citizens to tell the difference between media hype and cold, hard fact?

As a Canadian I must ask two questions:

-What do you see as the most important issue concerning Canada-US relations?
Mr President, what an honor to actually be able to ask you a question. It should be noted that I did not vote for you in 2008 and am considering voting for you in 2012. I did not vote Republican in 2008 either, I am an independent.

One reason I hesitate to support the Democratic party is that it seems so unwilling to call out lies thrown at them by the Republicans. For example, one typical talking point from the right is about 'a welfare state'. It is a fact that red states take in more federal money than they give in on average. Another talking point has to do with fiscal responsibility and yet debt has exploded under every president since Reagan. The list goes on and on. I don't understand why Democrats just don't parrot these retorts every time these points are brought up. I feel that part of it is that the lie is repeated over and over and in a talkign points world it is hard to get a full sentence in. However, it *feels* like the Democrats allow the Republicans to lie. I don't want to support a party that can't even stand up for itself when the truth is on their side simply because how are you going to stand up for yourself in a complicated policy debate when there is no one truth? I'm not suggesting be rude or aggressive. There is a way to do this that would be polite and would pass the "Would my mother be proud?" test. What will your party do to fix this issue and try to be more assertive in the war of public information?

Mr. President, I have a lot of family living in Mexico, and every time I see them, they consider their relationship with the US to be a double-edged sword.  With so many people living in poverty, crime, and squalor just south of our own borders, what sort of pressures can, will, or does your administration try to help the conditions of one of our most important economic and political allies?

Also, in a completely unrelated manor, I loved following the stories about Bo when you first adopted him.  Does he sleep in your room, with the girls, or does he have his own wing, as my dog often thinks he does?

You continue to take credit for extrajudicial assassinations from the CIA's drone program through officials "speaking on condition of anonymity" but refuse to officially confirm the program.

Many articles and international references to our nation's current political climate label it as more polarized than any political landscape in over a hundred years.

Do you have any ideas about how the country can be drawn back into the prideful and patriotic nation that existed in the 50s or early 60s (or even the 80s/90s)?  Is it even possible considering the rhetoric and propaganda from our national news media fueling the political fire?

Mr. President, it is a pleasure to have an opportunity to pick your brain. I have a great deal of respect for you and all that you've accomplished. 

Do you believe the party system is the most effective way for a functioning democracy to operate? George Washington was leery of political parties and spoke out against them in his farewell address.

The quote: 

"However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.

GEORGE WASHINGTON, Farewell Address, Sep. 17, 1796"

Do you believe he was right?
Mr. President, thank you for doing this.

Hi Mr. President. I have a few questions for you. 

1.  What do you do to keep yourself upbeat when the extreme right wing media and politicians seem intent on a campaign of misinformation and hate? 

2. Are you disheartened by the constant battle and bickering that Congress put you through during the past four years? Are you optimistic about the future? 

3. What is one thing (other than vote) that you wish every American would do?

As concerned as we are about rising health care costs, little to nothing is being done to combat fraudulent and unsupported medical procedures.  **Homeopathy, Acupuncture, and Chiropractic** practitioners are costing us every year and giving nothing but a placebo effect in return.

**Are you doing anything to combat this?  And if not, why?  How can we have serious healthcare reform when so much healthcare in this country is pseudo-scientific and in some instances insurance companies even pay for this junk.**

And thank you.  I'm confident you're doing your best job as president.
Can we see long form proof of presidency please?

...Sorry, had to.  My question is related to medical care: one of the biggest gripes I have about our medical payment system is insurers seem to pay FAR less than I would (being uninsured), making it something of a double whammy for me. Have you ever considered pushing for legislation saying that providers have to charge the exact same rate to all payer, regardless of whether they are patients or insurance companies? This would allow small insurers or even medium sized companies to provide insurance that is competitive with large insurers, even if they don't have the muscle to go around negotiating prices.

Best of luck in Novermber, we're counting on you!

First of all -- congrats on all you have accomplished in your first term and a huge thank you for doing this AMA!  So, my question:  

A major part of your initial campaign was a promise to change how politics work in Washington.  Given the current state of the election campaign from both sides clearly we haven't made enough progress on that so far.  If you're re-elected, will this become a top priority again?       

I'm saddened on a daily basis by the state of public discourse in this country, between politicans spewing ad hominem, to voter suppression tactics, to mass media being entirely biased on one side or another -- I'd just like some sanity again in the discourse of this country, and I think it needs to come from the top.

Good afternoon Mr. President,

Thank you very much for creating this thread. I am a D.C. native and am looking forward to voting for the first time in this election (am 21).

My question to you has to do with education. Our home is notorious for having some of the worst schools in the nation, yet our country is shoveling hundreds of billions of dollars into a war machine that isn't going to produce the best and brightest minds for generations to come. 

The kids in our city see the poverty and poor condition but are also lucky to be right next to the opposite. These kids have hope and see what their city has done to build up one of the greatest countries, and arguably any more.

Mr. Obama, how will you save our school?
Oh man... I have to at least try to ask you a question. 
1. Do you ever call up John Stewart for anything? 
2. That should not have been my first question, but oh well. 
3. I am, like most people, concerned that US Politics is becoming more theater than substance. Is there any way out of this wicked tailspin?

You're a beast!!
Mr. President, with Congress's approval rating at an all-time low, how do you hope to get our Senators and Representatives on both sides of the aisle cooperating with one another during your second term?  

Thank you!
Okay, true or false: One of the first things you did after the inauguration was ask the military/NSA for all the files on UFOs/EBEs, right?
Mr. President, I voted for you in the prior election.  I believed that you could turn around the economic situation that had been presented to you.  While we've seen recent increases (estimated second quarter growth more so than growth seen in first quarter), I'd be very interested to know your thoughts on how were can revitalize the economy more.  Economic issues are most important to me in who I vote for in the next election.

**Election reform**

America is the greatest democracy in the world. How come we only have two choices for president? Major (insurmountable) barriers have been raised for third parties.

The electoral college system is antiquated, and not fairly representative. It was designed in the era preceding telecommunication, and made sense then -- as it was the best they could do.

I realize this system has worked for you (and every other elected official) but it is far from ideal. There should be some serious discussion about this.

What are your thoughts on this issue?
Do you laugh every time you see Romney attempt to connect with the middle-class?
How have the expectations that you had before you became President differed from the realities of the job?
President Obama, it would mean a lot if you could answer my question. If and when you win this election, what will your administration do in regard to drug laws, particularly relating to that of marijuana? My question entails both official policy and your personal opinion on the matter. Thank you, it's an honor.
If there were one single policy or program that you could unilaterally implement without resistance/certain-doom from political opposition or a hit to public opinion, what would it be? 

I'm not necessarily asking for anything controversial or major...just one little pet thing that you could do without expending a single ounce of political capital.
I just want you to know that I appreciate all that you have accomplished and look forward to what you can do in the next four years.
Hi Mr. President, I'd just like to say that I think you're doing a great job and I look forward to voting for you come November.  However, I find the drone attacks, many of which kill civilians and aid responders as reprehensible and indefensible.  Why does your administration continue these attacks knowing the human cost?
Obviously, when the founding fathers designed the legislative branch of government, they never could have envisioned the current environment in which it operates. If you could make one change to the way Congress works via constitutional amendment (e.g. only 1 body, no filibuster, term limits, ...) what would it be?
Question:  would you like to endorse our band as awesome?  Thank you, Mr. President.
If you were in a different situation, who would you vote for president: Ron Paul or Mitt Romney?
For the life of me, I don't understand why you aren't fighting back harder against all the crazy accusations leveled your way.  There  is a difference between the "high road" and rightfully addressed weaknesses in your opponents.

Your speeches and meetings should contain DailyShow-style clips of all the crazy stuff your oponents say.  You should be forcefull in your rejection and their lies and wackiness.  Videos, clips, power point, charts, data, etc... these should be part of you arsenal.  You should be the first president take advantage of this media/technology presentation abilities.  We can't have another birth certificate story where you waited 2 years to take action.
How come the banks who crashed the economy aren't being persecuted?
Oh and one more thing please stop trying to "catch" julian assange. If you don't want people to uncover horrible things the US is doing, don't commit them. Other than that hope you win the election greetings for sweden.
Mr. President, Thank you for coming to reddit, please ignore the ignorant and hurtful comments that will probably end up on this thread. I for one am thrilled to see you reaching out to this demographic. I also truly applaud you for being so connected to the youth of the nation by being an "accessible" president, meaning you try and relate to the general public by doing things like this, talk shows, and other things the common people can enjoy and have a way to reach you. 

As for my question: Since you do seem to be concerned or attentive to education and the next generations, what can you do to add funding to schools? I understand we have extremely important issues abroad and hold a great debt, but why are schools being so heavily defunded instead of other businesses, institutions, etc. The future is in the quality of the school systems, so how can you, or the rest of the government help this growing problem?

Once again, thank you for doing this, you absolutely have my vote.
punch mitt romney and the other dumbass in the face for me.
Would you hang a shitty watercolor up in the white house if you got one?
Mr President, since your from Chicago, that must mean your a bears fan, and since i too am a bears fan tell me what you think our record will be this year. Yea thats right everybody im not taking this rare opportunity to ask a political question because im cool like that.
Why did you reverse your position on raiding medical marijuana dispensaries? Do you really think that the interests of the nation are served by jailing pot smokers and entrepeneurs? Why not just tax it like tobacco and spirits?
How do you feel about the office of president?  Do we still need one person at the top?  Do you think there are other options that would strengthen democracy?
Do you regret spending so much time and so much political capital on the ACA instead of say addressing climate change or immigration reform? If not, what are some regrets you have regarding your past 4 years in office?

Ps. Good luck against Mittens!
What do you feel about Islam, and what would you say to those young in the closet exmuslims (myself included) who are unable to live as they want, from fear of violence, excommunication and shunning? Even in countries like the USA and the UK?

I don't expect this to be answered but one can hope!
Nothing to say, just good luck in the upcoming election.

This AMA could possibly become the most upvoted thing on reddit ever...
As a Russian, I'm aware of Mr. Romney's strict stance against current Russian government. How do you see US-Russian relationships during your second term, especially considering the last parliamentary and presidential elections in Russia?
